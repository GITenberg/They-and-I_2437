<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> is not a large
house,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want a large
house.&nbsp; Two spare bedrooms, and the little three-cornered
place you see marked there on the plan, next to the bathroom, and
which will just do for a bachelor, will be all we shall
require&mdash;at all events, for the present.&nbsp; Later on, if
I ever get rich, we can throw out a wing.&nbsp; The kitchen I
shall have to break to your mother gently.&nbsp; Whatever the
original architect could have been thinking of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the kitchen,&rdquo; said Dick: &ldquo;what
about the billiard-room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way children nowadays will interrupt a parent is nothing
short of a national disgrace.&nbsp; I also wish Dick would not
sit on the table, swinging his legs.&nbsp; It is not
respectful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, when I was a boy,&rdquo; as I said
to him, &ldquo;I should as soon have thought of sitting on a
table, interrupting my father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this thing in the middle of the hall, that
looks like a grating?&rdquo; demanded Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She means the stairs,&rdquo; explained Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t they look like stairs?&rdquo;
commented Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;to people with
sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; persisted Robina, &ldquo;they
look like a grating.&rdquo;&nbsp; Robina, with the plan spread
out across her knee, was sitting balanced on the arm of an
easy-chair.&nbsp; Really, I hardly see the use of buying chairs
for these people.&nbsp; Nobody seems to know what they are
for&mdash;except it be one or another of the dogs.&nbsp; Perches
are all they want.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we threw the drawing-room into the hall and could do
away with the stairs,&rdquo; thought Robina, &ldquo;we should be
able to give a dance now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;you would like to
clear out the house altogether, leaving nothing but the four bare
walls.&nbsp; That would give us still more room, that
would.&nbsp; For just living in, we could fix up a shed in the
garden; or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking seriously,&rdquo; said Robina:
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the good of a drawing-room?&nbsp; One only
wants it to show the sort of people into that one wishes
hadn&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d sit about, looking
miserable, just as well anywhere else.&nbsp; If we could only get
rid of the stairs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course! we could get rid of the stairs,&rdquo; I
agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be a bit awkward at first, when we
wanted to go to bed.&nbsp; But I daresay we should get used to
it.&nbsp; We could have a ladder and climb up to our rooms
through the windows.&nbsp; Or we might adopt the Norwegian method
and have the stairs outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would be sensible,&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am trying to be,&rdquo; I explained; &ldquo;and I am
also trying to put a little sense into you.&nbsp; At present you
are crazy about dancing.&nbsp; If you had your way, you would
turn the house into a dancing-saloon with primitive
sleeping-accommodation attached.&nbsp; It will last six months,
your dancing craze.&nbsp; Then you will want the house
transformed into a swimming-bath, or a skating-rink, or cleared
out for hockey.&nbsp; My idea may be conventional.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t expect you to sympathise with it.&nbsp; My notion is
just an ordinary Christian house, not a gymnasium.&nbsp; There
are going to be bedrooms in this house, and there&rsquo;s going
to be a staircase leading to them.&nbsp; It may strike you as
sordid, but there is also going to be a kitchen: though why when
building the house they should have put the kitchen&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the billiard-room,&rdquo; said
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you thought more of your future career and less
about billiards,&rdquo; Robin pointed out to him, &ldquo;perhaps
you&rsquo;d get through your Little-go in the course of the next
few years.&nbsp; If Pa only had sense&mdash;I mean if he
wasn&rsquo;t so absurdly indulgent wherever you are concerned, he
would not have a billiard-table in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like that,&rdquo; retorted Dick, &ldquo;merely
because you can&rsquo;t play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can beat you, anyhow,&rdquo; retorted Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; admitted Dick&mdash;&ldquo;once in six
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice,&rdquo; corrected Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t play,&rdquo; Dick explained to her;
&ldquo;you just whack round and trust to Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t whack round,&rdquo; said Robin; &ldquo;I
always aim at something.&nbsp; When you try and it doesn&rsquo;t
come off, you say it&rsquo;s &lsquo;hard luck;&rsquo; and when I
try and it does come off, you say it&rsquo;s fluking.&nbsp; So
like a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You both of you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;attach too much
importance to the score.&nbsp; When you try for a cannon off the
white and hit it on the wrong side and send it into a pocket, and
your own ball travels on and makes a losing hazard off the red,
instead of being vexed with yourselves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you get a really good table, governor,&rdquo; said
Dick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you billiards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do believe Dick really thinks he can play.&nbsp; It is the
same with golf.&nbsp; Beginners are invariably lucky.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think I shall like it,&rdquo; they tell you; &ldquo;I
seem to have the game in me, if you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a friend of mine, an old sea-captain.&nbsp; He
is the sort of man that when the three balls are lying in a
straight line, tucked up under the cushion, looks pleased;
because then he knows he can make a cannon and leave the red just
where he wants it.&nbsp; An Irish youngster named Malooney, a
college chum of Dick&rsquo;s, was staying with us; and the
afternoon being wet, the Captain said he would explain it to
Malooney, how a young man might practise billiards without any
danger of cutting the cloth.&nbsp; He taught him how to hold the
cue, and he told him how to make a bridge.&nbsp; Malooney was
grateful, and worked for about an hour.&nbsp; He did not show
much promise.&nbsp; He is a powerfully built young man, and he
didn&rsquo;t seem able to get it into his head that he
wasn&rsquo;t playing cricket.&nbsp; Whenever he hit a little low
the result was generally lost ball.&nbsp; To save time&mdash;and
damage to furniture&mdash;Dick and I fielded for him.&nbsp; Dick
stood at long-stop, and I was short slip.&nbsp; It was dangerous
work, however, and when Dick had caught him out twice running, we
agreed that we had won, and took him in to tea.&nbsp; In the
evening&mdash;none of the rest of us being keen to try our luck a
second time&mdash;the Captain said, that just for the joke of the
thing he would give Malooney eighty-five and play him a hundred
up.&nbsp; To confess the truth, I find no particular fun myself
in playing billiards with the Captain.&nbsp; The game consists,
as far as I am concerned, in walking round the table, throwing
him back the balls, and saying &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;&nbsp; By the
time my turn comes I don&rsquo;t seem to care what happens:
everything seems against me.&nbsp; He is a kind old gentleman and
he means well, but the tone in which he says &ldquo;Hard
lines!&rdquo; whenever I miss an easy stroke irritates me.&nbsp;
I feel I&rsquo;d like to throw the balls at his head and fling
the table out of window.&nbsp; I suppose it is that I am in a
fretful state of mind, but the mere way in which he chalks his
cue aggravates me.&nbsp; He carries his own chalk in his
waistcoat pocket&mdash;as if our chalk wasn&rsquo;t good enough
for him&mdash;and when he has finished chalking, he smooths the
tip round with his finger and thumb and taps the cue against the
table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! go on with the game,&rdquo; I want to say
to him; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be so full of tricks.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Captain led off with a miss in baulk.&nbsp; Malooney
gripped his cue, drew in a deep breath, and let fly.&nbsp; The
result was ten: a cannon and all three balls in the same
pocket.&nbsp; As a matter of fact he made the cannon twice; but
the second time, as we explained to him, of course did not
count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good beginning!&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>
<p>Malooney seemed pleased with himself, and took off his
coat.</p>
<p>Malooney&rsquo;s ball missed the red on its first journey up
the table by about a foot, but found it later on and sent it into
a pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninety-nine plays nothing,&rdquo; said Dick, who was
marking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Better make it a hundred and fifty,
hadn&rsquo;t we, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to get in a shot,&rdquo; said the
Captain, &ldquo;before the game is over.&nbsp; Perhaps we had
better make it a hundred and fifty, if Mr. Malooney has no
objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you think right, sir,&rdquo; said Rory
Malooney.</p>
<p>Malooney finished his break for twenty-two, leaving himself
hanging over the middle pocket and the red tucked up in
baulk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing plays a hundred and eight,&rdquo; said
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I want the score,&rdquo; said the Captain,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate a noisy game,&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>
<p>The Captain, making up his mind without much waste of time,
sent his ball under the cushion, six inches outside baulk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will I do here?&rdquo; asked Malooney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you will do,&rdquo; said the
Captain; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owing to the position of the ball, Malooney was unable to
employ his whole strength.&nbsp; All he did that turn was to
pocket the Captain&rsquo;s ball and leave himself under the
bottom cushion, four inches from the red.&nbsp; The Captain said
a nautical word, and gave another miss.&nbsp; Malooney squared up
to the balls for the third time.&nbsp; They flew before him,
panic-stricken.&nbsp; They banged against one another, came back
and hit one another again for no reason whatever.&nbsp; The red,
in particular, Malooney had succeeded apparently in frightening
out of its wits.&nbsp; It is a stupid ball, generally speaking,
our red&mdash;its one idea to get under a cushion and watch the
game.&nbsp; With Malooney it soon found it was safe nowhere on
the table.&nbsp; Its only hope was pockets.&nbsp; I may have been
mistaken, my eye may have been deceived by the rapidity of the
play, but it seemed to me that the red never waited to be
hit.&nbsp; When it saw Malooney&rsquo;s ball coming for it at the
rate of forty miles an hour, it just made for the nearest
pocket.&nbsp; It rushed round the table looking for
pockets.&nbsp; If in its excitement, it passed an empty pocket,
it turned back and crawled in.&nbsp; There were times when in its
terror it jumped the table and took shelter under the sofa or
behind the sideboard.&nbsp; One began to feel sorry for the
red.</p>
<p>The Captain had scored a legitimate thirty-eight, and Malooney
had given him twenty-four, when it really seemed as if the
Captain&rsquo;s chance had come.&nbsp; I could have scored myself
as the balls were then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty-two plays one hundred and twenty-eight.&nbsp; Now
then, Captain, game in your hands,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>We gathered round.&nbsp; The children left their play.&nbsp;
It was a pretty picture: the bright young faces, eager with
expectation, the old worn veteran squinting down his cue, as if
afraid that watching Malooney&rsquo;s play might have given it
the squirms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now follow this,&rdquo; I whispered to Malooney.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t notice merely what he does, but try and
understand why he does it.&nbsp; Any fool&mdash;after a little
practice, that is&mdash;can hit a ball.&nbsp; But why do you hit
it?&nbsp; What happens after you&rsquo;ve hit it?&nbsp;
What&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>The Captain drew his cue back and gently pushed it
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty stroke,&rdquo; I whispered to Malooney;
&ldquo;now, that&rsquo;s the sort&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I offer, by way of explanation, that the Captain by this time
was probably too full of bottled-up language to be master of his
nerves.&nbsp; The ball travelled slowly past the red.&nbsp; Dick
said afterwards that you couldn&rsquo;t have put so much as a
sheet of paper between them.&nbsp; It comforts a man, sometimes,
when you tell him this; and at other times it only makes him
madder.&nbsp; It travelled on and passed the white&mdash;you
could have put quite a lot of paper between it and the
white&mdash;and dropped with a contented thud into the top
left-hand pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does he do that?&rdquo; Malooney whispered.&nbsp;
Malooney has a singularly hearty whisper.</p>
<p>Dick and I got the women and children out of the room as
quickly as we could, but of course Veronica managed to tumble
over something on the way&mdash;Veronica would find something to
tumble over in the desert of Sahara; and a few days later I
overheard expressions, scorching their way through the nursery
door, that made my hair rise up.&nbsp; I entered, and found
Veronica standing on the table.&nbsp; Jumbo was sitting upon the
music-stool.&nbsp; The poor dog himself was looking scared,
though he must have heard a bit of language in his time, one way
and another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are you not ashamed of
yourself?&nbsp; You wicked child, how dare you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Veronica.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really mean any harm.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
sailor, and I have to talk to him like that, else he don&rsquo;t
know he&rsquo;s being talked to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pay hard-working, conscientious ladies to teach this child
things right and proper for her to know.&nbsp; They tell her
clever things that Julius C&aelig;sar said; observations made by
Marcus Aurelius that, pondered over, might help her to become a
beautiful character.&nbsp; She complains that it produces a
strange buzzy feeling in her head; and her mother argues that
perhaps her brain is of the creative order, not intended to
remember much&mdash;thinks that perhaps she is going to be
something.&nbsp; A good round-dozen oaths the Captain must have
let fly before Dick and I succeeded in rolling her out of the
room.&nbsp; She had only heard them once, yet, so far as I could
judge, she had got them letter perfect.</p>
<p>The Captain, now no longer under the necessity of employing
all his energies to suppress his natural instincts, gradually
recovered form, and eventually the game stood at one hundred and
forty-nine all, Malooney to play.&nbsp; The Captain had left the
balls in a position that would have disheartened any other
opponent than Malooney.&nbsp; To any other opponent than Malooney
the Captain would have offered irritating sympathy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Afraid the balls are not rolling well for you
to-night,&rdquo; the Captain would have said; or, &ldquo;Sorry,
sir, I don&rsquo;t seem to have left you very much.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To-night the Captain wasn&rsquo;t feeling playful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he scores off that!&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Short of locking up the balls and turning out the
lights, I don&rsquo;t myself see how one is going to stop
him,&rdquo; sighed the Captain.</p>
<p>The Captain&rsquo;s ball was in hand.&nbsp; Malooney went for
the red and hit&mdash;perhaps it would be more correct to say,
frightened&mdash;it into a pocket.&nbsp; Malooney&rsquo;s ball,
with the table to itself, then gave a solo performance, and ended
up by breaking a window.&nbsp; It was what the lawyers call a
nice point.&nbsp; What was the effect upon the score?</p>
<p>Malooney argued that, seeing he had pocketed the red before
his own ball left the table, his three should be counted first,
and that therefore he had won.&nbsp; Dick maintained that a ball
that had ended up in a flower-bed couldn&rsquo;t be deemed to
have scored anything.&nbsp; The Captain declined to assist.&nbsp;
He said that, although he had been playing billiards for upwards
of forty years, the incident was new to him.&nbsp; My own feeling
was that of thankfulness that we had got through the game without
anybody being really injured.&nbsp; We agreed that the person to
decide the point would be the editor of <i>The Field</i>.</p>
<p>It remains still undecided.&nbsp; The Captain came into my
study the next morning.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;If you
haven&rsquo;t written that letter to <i>The Field</i>,
don&rsquo;t mention my name.&nbsp; They know me on <i>The
Field</i>.&nbsp; I would rather it did not get about that I have
been playing with a man who cannot keep his ball within the four
walls of a billiard-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I know most of the
fellows on <i>The Field</i> myself.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t often
get hold of anything novel in the way of a story.&nbsp; When they
do, they are apt to harp upon it.&nbsp; My idea was to keep my
own name out of it altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a point likely to crop up often,&rdquo; said
the Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d let it rest if I were
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should like to have had it settled.&nbsp; In the end, I
wrote the editor a careful letter, in a disguised hand, giving a
false name and address.&nbsp; But if any answer ever appeared I
must have missed it.</p>
<p>Myself I have a sort of consciousness that somewhere inside me
there is quite a good player, if only I could persuade him to
come out.&nbsp; He is shy, that is all.&nbsp; He does not seem
able to play when people are looking on.&nbsp; The shots he
misses when people are looking on would give you a wrong idea of
him.&nbsp; When nobody is about, a prettier game you do not often
see.&nbsp; If some folks who fancy themselves could see me when
there is nobody about, it might take the conceit out of
them.&nbsp; Only once I played up to what I feel is my real form,
and then it led to argument.&nbsp; I was staying at an hotel in
Switzerland, and the second evening a pleasant-spoken young
fellow, who said he had read all my books&mdash;later, he
appeared surprised on learning I had written more than
two&mdash;asked me if I would care to play a hundred up.&nbsp; We
played even, and I paid for the table.&nbsp; The next evening he
said he thought it would make a better game if he gave me forty
and I broke.&nbsp; It was a fairly close finish, and afterwards
he suggested that I should put down my name for the handicap they
were arranging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;that I hardly
play well enough.&nbsp; Just a quiet game with you is one thing;
but in a handicap with a crowd looking on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not let that trouble you,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;there are some here who play worse than you&mdash;just one
or two.&nbsp; It passes the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was merely a friendly affair.&nbsp; I paid my twenty marks,
and was given plus a hundred.&nbsp; I drew for my first game a
chatty type of man, who started minus twenty.&nbsp; We neither of
us did much for the first five minutes, and then I made a break
of forty-four.</p>
<p>There was not a fluke in it from beginning to end.&nbsp; I was
never more astonished in my life.&nbsp; It seemed to me it was
the cue was doing it.</p>
<p>Minus Twenty was even more astonished.&nbsp; I heard him as I
passed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who handicapped this man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said the pleasant-spoken youngster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Minus Twenty&mdash;&ldquo;friend of
yours, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are evenings that seem to belong to you.&nbsp; We
finished that two hundred and fifty under the three-quarters of
an hour.&nbsp; I explained to Minus Twenty&mdash;he was plus
sixty-three at the end&mdash;that my play that night had been
exceptional.&nbsp; He said that he had heard of cases
similar.&nbsp; I left him talking volubly to the committee.&nbsp;
He was not a nice man at all.</p>
<p>After that I did not care to win; and that of course was
fatal.&nbsp; The less I tried, the more impossible it seemed for
me to do wrong.&nbsp; I was left in at the last with a man from
another hotel.&nbsp; But for that I am convinced I should have
carried off the handicap.&nbsp; Our hotel didn&rsquo;t, anyhow,
want the other hotel to win.&nbsp; So they gathered round me, and
offered me sound advice, and begged me to be careful; with the
natural result that I went back to my usual form quite
suddenly.</p>
<p>Never before or since have I played as I played that
week.&nbsp; But it showed me what I could do.&nbsp; I shall get a
new table, with proper pockets this time.&nbsp; There is
something wrong about our pockets.&nbsp; The balls go into them
and then come out again.&nbsp; You would think they had seen
something there to frighten them.&nbsp; They come out trembling
and hold on to the cushion.</p>
<p>I shall also get a new red ball.&nbsp; I fancy it must be a
very old ball, our red.&nbsp; It seems to me to be always
tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The billiard-room,&rdquo; I said to Dick, &ldquo;I see
my way to easily enough.&nbsp; Adding another ten feet to what is
now the dairy will give us twenty-eight by twenty.&nbsp; I am
hopeful that will be sufficient even for your friend
Malooney.&nbsp; The drawing-room is too small to be of any
use.&nbsp; I may decide&mdash;as Robina has suggested&mdash;to
&lsquo;throw it into the hall.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the stairs will
remain.&nbsp; For dancing, private theatricals&mdash;things to
keep you children out of mischief&mdash;I have an idea I will
explain to you later on.&nbsp; The kitchen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I have a room to myself?&rdquo; asked Veronica.</p>
<p>Veronica was sitting on the floor, staring into the fire, her
chin supported by her hand.&nbsp; Veronica, in those rare moments
when she is resting from her troubles, wears a holy, far-away
expression apt to mislead the stranger.&nbsp; Governesses, new to
her, have their doubts whether on these occasions they are
justified in dragging her back to discuss mere dates and
tables.&nbsp; Poets who are friends of mine, coming unexpectedly
upon Veronica standing by the window, gazing upward at the
evening star, have thought it was a vision, until they got closer
and found that she was sucking peppermints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should so like to have a room all to myself,&rdquo;
added Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a room!&rdquo; commented Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have your hairpins sticking up all
over the bed, anyhow,&rdquo; murmured Veronica dreamily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that!&rdquo; said Robin;
&ldquo;why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re harder than I am,&rdquo; said
Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should wish you to have a room, Veronica,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;My fear is that in place of one untidy bedroom
in the house&mdash;a room that makes me shudder every time I see
it through the open door; and the door, in spite of all I can
say, generally is wide open&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not untidy,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;not
really.&nbsp; I know where everything is in the dark&mdash;if
people would only leave them alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re about the most untidy girl
I know,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Robin; &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t see other girls&rsquo; rooms.&nbsp; Look at yours at
Cambridge.&nbsp; Malooney told us you&rsquo;d had a fire, and we
all believed him at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man&rsquo;s working&mdash;&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have an orderly place to work in,&rdquo;
suggested Robin.</p>
<p>Dick sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never any good talking to
you,&rdquo; said Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even see your
own faults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said Robin; &ldquo;I see them more than
anyone.&nbsp; All I claim is justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me, Veronica,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that you are
worthy to possess a room.&nbsp; At present you appear to regard
the whole house as your room.&nbsp; I find your gaiters on the
croquet lawn.&nbsp; A portion of your costume&mdash;an article
that anyone possessed of the true feelings of a lady would desire
to keep hidden from the world&mdash;is discovered waving from the
staircase window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it out to be mended,&rdquo; explained
Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You opened the door and flung it out.&nbsp; I told you
of it at the time,&rdquo; said Robin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do the
same with your boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too high-spirited for your size,&rdquo;
explained Dick to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Try to be less
dashing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could also wish, Veronica,&rdquo; I continued,
&ldquo;that you shed your back comb less easily, or at least that
you knew when you had shed it.&nbsp; As for your
gloves&mdash;well, hunting your gloves has come to be our leading
winter sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People look in such funny places for them,&rdquo; said
Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted.&nbsp; But be just, Veronica,&rdquo; I
pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Admit that it is in funny places we
occasionally find them.&nbsp; When looking for your things one
learns, Veronica, never to despair.&nbsp; So long as there
remains a corner unexplored inside or outside the house, within
the half-mile radius, hope need not be abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica was still gazing dreamily into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Veronica, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
reditty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She means heredity,&rdquo; suggested
Dick&mdash;&ldquo;cheeky young beggar!&nbsp; I wonder you let her
talk to you the way she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Robin, &ldquo;as I am always
explaining to you, Pa is a literary man.&nbsp; With him it is
part of his temperament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard on us children,&rdquo; said
Veronica.</p>
<p>We were all agreed&mdash;with the exception of
Veronica&mdash;that it was time Veronica went to bed.&nbsp; As
chairman I took it upon myself to closure the debate.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Do</span> you mean, Governor, that
you have actually bought the house?&rdquo; demanded Dick,
&ldquo;or are we only talking about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, Dick,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I have done
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked serious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it what you
wanted?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dick,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;it is not what I
wanted.&nbsp; I wanted an old-fashioned, picturesque, rambling
sort of a place, all gables and ivy and oriel windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mixing things up,&rdquo; Dick interrupted,
&ldquo;gables and oriel windows don&rsquo;t go
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Dick,&rdquo; I corrected him,
&ldquo;in the house I wanted, they do.&nbsp; It is the style of
house you find in the Christmas number.&nbsp; I have never seen
it anywhere else, but I took a fancy to it from the first.&nbsp;
It is not too far from the church, and it lights up well at
night.&nbsp; &lsquo;One of these days,&rsquo; I used to say to
myself when a boy, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be a clever man and live in
a house just like that.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was my dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is this place like?&rdquo; demanded Robin,
&ldquo;this place you have bought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The agent,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;claims for it
that it is capable of improvement.&nbsp; I asked him to what
school of architecture he would say it belonged; he said he
thought that it must have been a local school, and pointed
out&mdash;what seems to be the truth&mdash;that nowadays they do
not build such houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near to the river?&rdquo; demanded Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, by the road,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I daresay
it may be a couple of miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by the shortest way?&rdquo; questioned Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the shortest way,&rdquo; I explained;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a prettier way through the woods, but that
is about three miles and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we had decided it was to be near the river,&rdquo;
said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also decided,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that it was
to be on sandy soil, with a south-west aspect.&nbsp; Only one
thing in this house has a south-west aspect, and that&rsquo;s the
back door.&nbsp; I asked the agent about the sand.&nbsp; He
advised me, if I wanted it in any quantity, to get an estimate
from the Railway Company.&nbsp; I wanted it on a hill.&nbsp; It
is on a hill, with a bigger hill in front of it.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t want that other hill.&nbsp; I wanted an
uninterrupted view of the southern half of England.&nbsp; I
wanted to take people out on the step, and cram them with stories
about our being able on clear days to see the Bristol
Channel.&nbsp; They might not have believed me, but without that
hill I could have stuck to it, and they could not have been
certain&mdash;not dead certain&mdash;I was lying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally, I should have liked a house where something
had happened.&nbsp; I should have liked, myself, a
blood-stain&mdash;not a fussy blood-stain, a neat unobtrusive
blood-stain that would have been content, most of its time, to
remain hidden under the mat, shown only occasionally as a treat
to visitors.&nbsp; I had hopes even of a ghost.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean one of those noisy ghosts that doesn&rsquo;t
seem to know it is dead.&nbsp; A lady ghost would have been my
fancy, a gentle ghost with quiet, pretty ways.&nbsp; This
house&mdash;well, it is such a sensible-looking house, that is my
chief objection to it.&nbsp; It has got an echo.&nbsp; If you go
to the end of the garden and shout at it very loudly, it answers
you back.&nbsp; This is the only bit of fun you can have with
it.&nbsp; Even then it answers you in such a tone you feel it
thinks the whole thing silly&mdash;is doing it merely to humour
you.&nbsp; It is one of those houses that always seems to be
thinking of its rates and taxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any reason at all for your having bought it?&rdquo;
asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dick,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are all
of us tired of this suburb.&nbsp; We want to live in the country
and be good.&nbsp; To live in the country with any comfort it is
necessary to have a house there.&nbsp; This being admitted, it
follows we must either build a house or buy one.&nbsp; I would
rather not build a house.&nbsp; Talboys built himself a
house.&nbsp; You know Talboys.&nbsp; When I first met him, before
he started building, he was a cheerful soul with a kindly word
for everyone.&nbsp; The builder assures him that in another
twenty years, when the colour has had time to tone down, his
house will be a picture.&nbsp; At present it makes him bilious,
the mere sight of it.&nbsp; Year by year, they tell him, as the
dampness wears itself away, he will suffer less and less from
rheumatism, ague, and lumbago.&nbsp; He has a hedge round the
garden; it is eighteen inches high.&nbsp; To keep the boys out he
has put up barbed-wire fencing.&nbsp; But wire fencing affords no
real privacy.&nbsp; When the Talboys are taking coffee on the
lawn, there is generally a crowd from the village watching
them.&nbsp; There are trees in the garden; you know they are
trees&mdash;there is a label tied to each one telling you what
sort of tree it is.&nbsp; For the moment there is a similarity
about them.&nbsp; Thirty years hence, Talboys estimates, they
will afford him shade and comfort; but by that time he hopes to
be dead.&nbsp; I want a house that has got over all its troubles;
I don&rsquo;t want to spend the rest of my life bringing up a
young and inexperienced house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why this particular house?&rdquo; urged Robin,
&ldquo;if, as you say, it is not the house you wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, my dear girl,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;it is
less unlike the house I wanted than other houses I have
seen.&nbsp; When we are young we make up our minds to try and get
what we want; when we have arrived at years of discretion we
decide to try and want what we can get.&nbsp; It saves
time.&nbsp; During the last two years I have seen about sixty
houses, and out of the lot there was only one that was really the
house I wanted.&nbsp; Hitherto I have kept the story to
myself.&nbsp; Even now, thinking about it irritates me.&nbsp; It
was not an agent who told me of it.&nbsp; I met a man by chance
in a railway carriage.&nbsp; He had a black eye.&nbsp; If ever I
meet him again I&rsquo;ll give him another.&nbsp; He accounted
for it by explaining that he had had trouble with a golf ball,
and at the time I believed him.&nbsp; I mentioned to him in
conversation I was looking for a house.&nbsp; He described this
place to me, and it seemed to me hours before the train stopped
at a station.&nbsp; When it did I got out and took the next train
back.&nbsp; I did not even wait for lunch.&nbsp; I had my bicycle
with me, and I went straight there.&nbsp; It was&mdash;well, it
was the house I wanted.&nbsp; If it had vanished suddenly, and I
had found myself in bed, the whole thing would have seemed more
reasonable.&nbsp; The proprietor opened the door to me
himself.&nbsp; He had the bearing of a retired military
man.&nbsp; It was afterwards I learnt he was the proprietor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Good afternoon; if it is not troubling
you, I would like to look over the house.&rsquo;&nbsp; We were
standing in the oak-panelled hall.&nbsp; I noticed the carved
staircase about which the man in the train had told me, also the
Tudor fireplaces.&nbsp; That is all I had time to notice.&nbsp;
The next moment I was lying on my back in the middle of the
gravel with the door shut.&nbsp; I looked up.&nbsp; I saw the old
maniac&rsquo;s head sticking out of a little window.&nbsp; It was
an evil face.&nbsp; He had a gun in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to count twenty,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you are not the other side of the gate by
then, I shoot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ran over the figures myself on my way to the
gate.&nbsp; I made it eighteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had an hour to wait for the train.&nbsp; I talked the
matter over with the station-master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there&rsquo;ll be
trouble up there one of these days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;It seems to me to have begun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the Indian sun.&nbsp; It
gets into their heads.&nbsp; We have one or two in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; They are quiet enough till something
happens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I&rsquo;d been two seconds longer,&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;I believe he&rsquo;d have done it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a taking house,&rsquo; said the
station-master; &lsquo;not too big and not too little.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the sort of house people seem to be looking
for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t envy,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the
next person that finds it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He settled himself down here,&rsquo; said the
station-master, &lsquo;about ten years ago.&nbsp; Since then, if
one person has offered to take the house off his hands, I suppose
a thousand have.&nbsp; At first he would laugh at them
good-temperedly&mdash;explain to them that his idea was to live
there himself, in peace and quietness, till he died.&nbsp; Two
out of every three of them would express their willingness to
wait for that, and suggest some arrangement by which they might
enter into possession, say, a week after the funeral.&nbsp; The
last few months it has been worse than ever.&nbsp; I reckon
you&rsquo;re about the eighth that has been up there this week,
and to-day only Thursday.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something to be
said, you know, for the old man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did he,&rdquo; asked Dick&mdash;&ldquo;did he shoot
the next party that came along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so silly, Dick,&rdquo; said Robin;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a story.&nbsp; Tell us another, Pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Robina, by a
story,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you mean to
imply&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina said she didn&rsquo;t; but I know quite well she
did.&nbsp; Because I am an author, and have to tell stories for
my living, people think I don&rsquo;t know any truth.&nbsp; It is
vexing enough to be doubted when one is exaggerating; to have
sneers flung at one by one&rsquo;s own kith and kin when one is
struggling to confine oneself to bald, bare narrative&mdash;well,
where is the inducement to be truthful?&nbsp; There are times
when I almost say to myself that I will never tell the truth
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it happens,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the story is true,
in many places.&nbsp; I pass over your indifference to the risk I
ran; though a nice girl at the point where the gun was mentioned
would have expressed alarm.&nbsp; Anyhow, at the end you might
have said something more sympathetic than merely, &lsquo;Tell us
another.&rsquo;&nbsp; He did not shoot the next party that
arrived, for the reason that the very next day his wife, alarmed
at what had happened, went up to London and consulted an
expert&mdash;none too soon, as it turned out.&nbsp; The poor old
fellow died six months later in a private lunatic asylum; I had
it from the station-master on passing through the junction again
this spring.&nbsp; The house fell into the possession of his
nephew, who is living in it now.&nbsp; He is a youngish man with
a large family, and people have learnt that the place is not for
sale.&nbsp; It seems to me rather a sad story.&nbsp; The Indian
sun, as the station-master thinks, may have started the trouble;
but the end was undoubtedly hastened by the annoyance to which
the unfortunate gentleman had been subjected; and I myself might
have been shot.&nbsp; The only thing that comforts me is thinking
of that fool&rsquo;s black eye&mdash;the fool that sent me
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And none of the other houses,&rdquo; suggested Dick,
&ldquo;were any good at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were drawbacks, Dick,&rdquo; I explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was a house in Essex; it was one of the first your
mother and I inspected.&nbsp; I nearly shed tears of joy when I
read the advertisement.&nbsp; It had once been a priory.&nbsp;
Queen Elizabeth had slept there on her way to Greenwich.&nbsp; A
photograph of the house accompanied the advertisement.&nbsp; I
should not have believed the thing had it been a picture.&nbsp;
It was under twelve miles from Charing Cross.&nbsp; The owner, it
was stated, was open to offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All humbug, I suppose,&rdquo; suggested Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The advertisement, if anything,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;had under-estimated the attractiveness of that
house.&nbsp; All I blame the advertisement for is that it did not
mention other things.&nbsp; It did not mention, for instance,
that since Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time the neighbourhood had
changed.&nbsp; It did not mention that the entrance was between a
public-house one side of the gate and a fried-fish shop on the
other; that the Great Eastern Railway-Company had established a
goods depot at the bottom of the garden; that the drawing-room
windows looked out on extensive chemical works, and the
dining-room windows, which were round the corner, on a
stonemason&rsquo;s yard.&nbsp; The house itself was a
dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the sense of it?&rdquo; demanded
Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do house agents think is the good of
it?&nbsp; Do they think people likely to take a house after
reading the advertisement without ever going to see
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked an agent once that very question,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;He said they did it first and foremost to
keep up the spirits of the owner&mdash;the man who wanted to sell
the house.&nbsp; He said that when a man was trying to part with
a house he had to listen to so much abuse of it from people who
came to see it that if somebody did not stick up for the
house&mdash;say all that could be said for it, and gloss over its
defects&mdash;he would end by becoming so ashamed of it he would
want to give it away, or blow it up with dynamite.&nbsp; He said
that reading the advertisement in the agent&rsquo;s catalogue was
the only thing that reconciled him to being the owner of the
house.&nbsp; He said one client of his had been trying to sell
his house for years&mdash;until one day in the office he read by
chance the agent&rsquo;s description of it.&nbsp; Upon which he
went straight home, took down the board, and has lived there
contentedly ever since.&nbsp; From that point of view there is
reason in the system; but for the house-hunter it works
badly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One agent sent me a day&rsquo;s journey to see a house
standing in the middle of a brickfield, with a view of the Grand
Junction Canal.&nbsp; I asked him where was the river he had
mentioned.&nbsp; He explained it was the other side of the canal,
but on a lower level; that was the only reason why from the house
you couldn&rsquo;t see it.&nbsp; I asked him for his picturesque
scenery.&nbsp; He explained it was farther on, round the
bend.&nbsp; He seemed to think me unreasonable, expecting to find
everything I wanted just outside the front-door.&nbsp; He
suggested my shutting out the brickfield&mdash;if I didn&rsquo;t
like the brickfield&mdash;with trees.&nbsp; He suggested the
eucalyptus-tree.&nbsp; He said it was a rapid grower.&nbsp; He
also told me that it yielded gum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another house I travelled down into Dorsetshire to
see.&nbsp; It contained, according to the advertisement,
&lsquo;perhaps the most perfect specimen of Norman arch extant in
Southern England.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was to be found mentioned in
Dugdale, and dated from the thirteenth century.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t quite know what I expected.&nbsp; I argued to myself
that there must have been ruffians of only moderate means even in
those days.&nbsp; Here and there some robber baron who had struck
a poor line of country would have had to be content with a homely
little castle.&nbsp; A few such, hidden away in unfrequented
districts, had escaped destruction.&nbsp; More civilised
descendants had adapted them to later requirements.&nbsp; I had
in my mind, before the train reached Dorchester, something
between a miniature Tower of London and a medi&aelig;val edition
of Ann Hathaway&rsquo;s cottage at Stratford.&nbsp; I pictured
dungeons and a drawbridge, perhaps a secret passage.&nbsp;
Lamchick has a secret passage, leading from behind a sort of
portrait in the dining-room to the back of the kitchen
chimney.&nbsp; They use it for a linen closet.&nbsp; It seems to
me a pity.&nbsp; Of course originally it went on farther.&nbsp;
The vicar, who is a bit of an antiquarian, believes it comes out
somewhere in the churchyard.&nbsp; I tell Lamchick he ought to
have it opened up, but his wife doesn&rsquo;t want it
touched.&nbsp; She seems to think it just right as it is.&nbsp; I
have always had a fancy for a secret passage.&nbsp; I decided I
would have the drawbridge repaired and made practicable.&nbsp;
Flanked on each side with flowers in tubs, it would have been a
novel and picturesque approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there a drawbridge?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no drawbridge,&rdquo; I explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The entrance to the house was through what the caretaker
called the conservatory.&nbsp; It was not the sort of house that
goes with a drawbridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what about the Norman arches?&rdquo; argued
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not arches,&rdquo; I corrected him; &ldquo;Arch.&nbsp;
The Norman arch was downstairs in the kitchen.&nbsp; It was the
kitchen, that had been built in the thirteenth century&mdash;and
had not had much done to it since, apparently.&nbsp; Originally,
I should say, it had been the torture chamber; it gave you that
idea.&nbsp; I think your mother would have raised objections to
the kitchen&mdash;anyhow, when she came to think of the
cook.&nbsp; It would have been necessary to put it to the woman
before engaging her:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mind cooking in a dungeon in the
dark, do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some cooks would.&nbsp; The rest of the house was what
I should describe as present-day mixed style.&nbsp; The last
tenant but one had thrown out a bathroom in corrugated
iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there was a house in Berkshire that I took your
mother to see, with a trout stream running through the
grounds.&nbsp; I imagined myself going out after lunch, catching
trout for dinner; inviting swagger friends down to &lsquo;my
little place in Berkshire&rsquo; for a few days&rsquo;
trout-fishing.&nbsp; There is a man I once knew who is now a
baronet.&nbsp; He used to be keen on fishing.&nbsp; I thought
maybe I&rsquo;d get him.&nbsp; It would have looked well in the
Literary Gossip column: &lsquo;Among the other distinguished
guests&rsquo;&mdash;you know the sort of thing.&nbsp; I had the
paragraph already in my mind.&nbsp; The wonder is I didn&rsquo;t
buy a rod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there any trout stream?&rdquo; questioned
Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a stream,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;if
anything, too much stream.&nbsp; The stream was the first thing
your mother noticed.&nbsp; She noticed it a quarter of an hour
before we came to it&mdash;before we knew it was the
stream.&nbsp; We drove back to the town, and she bought a
smelling-bottle, the larger size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gave your mother a headache, that stream, and made
me mad.&nbsp; The agent&rsquo;s office was opposite the
station.&nbsp; I allowed myself half an hour on my way back to
tell him what I thought of him, and then I missed the
train.&nbsp; I could have got it in if he had let me talk all the
time, but he would interrupt.&nbsp; He said it was the people at
the paper-mill&mdash;that he had spoken to them about it more
than once; he seemed to think sympathy was all I wanted.&nbsp; He
assured me, on his word as a house-agent, that it had once been a
trout stream.&nbsp; The fact was historical.&nbsp; Isaac Walton
had fished there&mdash;that was prior to the paper-mill.&nbsp; He
thought a collection of trout, male and female, might be bought
and placed in it; preference being given to some hardy breed of
trout, accustomed to roughing it.&nbsp; I told him I wasn&rsquo;t
looking for a place where I could play at being Noah; and left
him, as I explained to him, with the intention of going straight
to my solicitors and instituting proceedings against him for
talking like a fool; and he put on his hat and went across to his
solicitors to commence proceedings against me for libel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that, with myself, he thought better of it in
the end.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m tired of having my life turned into
one perpetual first of April.&nbsp; This house that I have bought
is not my heart&rsquo;s desire, but about it there are
possibilities.&nbsp; We will put in lattice windows, and fuss-up
the chimneys.&nbsp; Maybe we will let in a tablet over the
front-door, with a date&mdash;always looks well: it is a
picturesque figure, the old-fashioned five.&nbsp; By the time we
have done with it&mdash;for all practical purposes&mdash;it will
be a Tudor manor-house.&nbsp; I have always wanted an old Tudor
manor-house.&nbsp; There is no reason, so far as I can see, why
there should not be stories connected with this house.&nbsp; Why
should not we have a room in which Somebody once slept?&nbsp; We
won&rsquo;t have Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tired of Queen
Elizabeth.&nbsp; Besides, I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;d have
been nice.&nbsp; Why not Queen Anne?&nbsp; A quiet, gentle old
lady, from all accounts, who would not have given trouble.&nbsp;
Or, better still, Shakespeare.&nbsp; He was constantly to and fro
between London and Stratford.&nbsp; It would not have been so
very much out of his way.&nbsp; &lsquo;The room where Shakespeare
slept!&rsquo;&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s a new idea.&nbsp; Nobody ever
seems to have thought of Shakespeare.&nbsp; There is the
four-post bedstead.&nbsp; Your mother never liked it.&nbsp; She
will insist, it harbours things.&nbsp; We might hang the wall
with scenes from his plays, and have a bust of the old gentleman
himself over the door.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m left alone and not
worried, I&rsquo;ll probably end by believing that he really did
sleep there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about cupboards?&rdquo; suggested Dick.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Little Mother will clamour for cupboards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is unexplainable, the average woman&rsquo;s passion for
cupboards.&nbsp; In heaven, her first request, I am sure, is
always, &ldquo;Can I have a cupboard?&rdquo;&nbsp; She would keep
her husband and children in cupboards if she had her way: that
would be her idea of the perfect home, everybody wrapped up with
a piece of camphor in his or her own proper cupboard.&nbsp; I
knew a woman once who was happy&mdash;for a woman.&nbsp; She
lived in a house with twenty-nine cupboards: I think it must have
been built by a woman.&nbsp; They were spacious cupboards, many
of them, with doors in no way different from other doors.&nbsp;
Visitors would wish each other good-night and disappear with
their candles into cupboards, staggering out backwards the next
moment, looking scared.&nbsp; One poor gentleman, this
woman&rsquo;s husband told me, having to go downstairs again for
something he had forgotten, and unable on his return to strike
anything else but cupboards, lost heart and finished up the night
in a cupboard.&nbsp; At breakfast-time guests would hurry down,
and burst open cupboard doors with a cheery
&ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; When that woman was out, nobody
in that house ever knew where anything was; and when she came
home she herself only knew where it ought to have been.&nbsp; Yet
once, when one of those twenty-nine cupboards had to be cleared
out temporarily for repairs, she never smiled, her husband told
me, for more than three weeks&mdash;not till the workmen were out
of the house, and that cupboard in working order again.&nbsp; She
said it was so confusing, having nowhere to put her things.</p>
<p>The average woman does not want a house, in the ordinary sense
of the word.&nbsp; What she wants is something made by a
genii.&nbsp; You have found, as you think, the ideal house.&nbsp;
You show her the Adams fireplace in the drawing-room.&nbsp; You
tap the wainscoting of the hall with your umbrella:
&ldquo;Oak,&rdquo; you impress upon her, &ldquo;all
oak.&rdquo;&nbsp; You draw her attention to the view: you tell
her the local legend.&nbsp; By fixing her head against the
window-pane she can see the tree on which the man was
hanged.&nbsp; You dwell upon the sundial; you mention for a
second time the Adams fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very nice,&rdquo; she answers,
&ldquo;but where are the children going to sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is so disheartening.</p>
<p>If it isn&rsquo;t the children, it&rsquo;s the water.&nbsp;
She wants water&mdash;wants to know where it comes from.&nbsp;
You show her where it comes from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, out of that nasty place!&rdquo; she exclaims.</p>
<p>She is equally dissatisfied whether it be drawn from a well,
or whether it be water that has fallen from heaven and been
stored in tanks.&nbsp; She has no faith in Nature&rsquo;s
water.&nbsp; A woman never believes that water can be good that
does not come from a water-works.&nbsp; Her idea appears to be
that the Company makes it fresh every morning from some old
family recipe.</p>
<p>If you do succeed in reconciling her to the water, then she
feels sure that the chimneys smoke; they look as if they
smoked.&nbsp; Why&mdash;as you tell her&mdash;the chimneys are
the best part of the house.&nbsp; You take her outside and make
her look at them.&nbsp; They are genuine sixteenth-century
chimneys, with carving on them.&nbsp; They couldn&rsquo;t
smoke.&nbsp; They wouldn&rsquo;t do anything so inartistic.&nbsp;
She says she only hopes you are right, and suggests cowls, if
they do.</p>
<p>After that she wants to see the kitchen&mdash;where&rsquo;s
the kitchen?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know where it is.&nbsp; You
didn&rsquo;t bother about the kitchen.&nbsp; There must be a
kitchen, of course.&nbsp; You proceed to search for the
kitchen.&nbsp; When you find it she is worried because it is the
opposite end of the house to the dining-room.&nbsp; You point out
to her the advantage of being away from the smell of the
cooking.&nbsp; At that she gets personal: tells you that you are
the first to grumble when the dinner is cold; and in her madness
accuses the whole male sex of being impractical.&nbsp; The mere
sight of an empty house makes a woman fretful.</p>
<p>Of course the stove is wrong.&nbsp; The kitchen stove always
is wrong.&nbsp; You promise she shall have a new one.&nbsp; Six
months later she will want the old one back again: but it would
be cruel to tell her this.&nbsp; The promise of that new stove
comforts her.&nbsp; The woman never loses hope that one day it
will come&mdash;the all-satisfying kitchen stove, the stove of
her girlish dreams.</p>
<p>The question of the stove settled, you imagine you have
silenced all opposition.&nbsp; At once she begins to talk about
things that nobody but a woman or a sanitary inspector can talk
about without blushing.</p>
<p>It calls for tact, getting a woman into a new house.&nbsp; She
is nervous, suspicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad, my dear Dick,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;that
you have mentioned cupboards.&nbsp; It is with cupboards that I
am hoping to lure your mother.&nbsp; The cupboards, from her
point of view, will be the one bright spot; there are fourteen of
them.&nbsp; I am trusting to cupboards to tide me over many
things.&nbsp; I shall want you to come with me, Dick.&nbsp;
Whenever your mother begins a sentence with: &lsquo;But now to be
practical, dear,&rsquo; I want you to murmur something about
cupboards&mdash;not irritatingly as if it had been prearranged:
have a little gumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be room for a tennis court?&rdquo; demanded
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent tennis court already exists,&rdquo; I
informed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have also purchased the adjoining
paddock.&nbsp; We shall be able to keep our own cow.&nbsp; Maybe
we&rsquo;ll breed horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have a croquet lawn,&rdquo; suggested
Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might easily have a croquet lawn,&rdquo; I
agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;On a full-sized lawn I believe Veronica
might be taught to play.&nbsp; There are natures that demand
space.&nbsp; On a full-sized lawn, protected by a stout iron
border, less time might be wasted exploring the surrounding
scenery for Veronica&rsquo;s lost ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance of a golf links anywhere in the
neighbourhood?&rdquo; feared Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Barely a mile away there is a pretty piece of gorse land
that appears to be no good to anyone.&nbsp; I daresay for a
reasonable offer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, when will this show be ready?&rdquo; interrupted
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I propose beginning the alterations at once,&rdquo; I
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;By luck there happens to be a
gamekeeper&rsquo;s cottage vacant and within distance.&nbsp; The
agent is going to get me the use of it for a year&mdash;a
primitive little place, but charmingly situate on the edge of a
wood.&nbsp; I shall furnish a couple of rooms; and for part of
every week I shall make a point of being down there,
superintending.&nbsp; I have always been considered good at
superintending.&nbsp; My poor father used to say it was the only
work I seemed to take an interest in.&nbsp; By being on the spot
to hurry everybody on I hope to have the &lsquo;show,&rsquo; as
you term it, ready by the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never marry,&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so easily discouraged,&rdquo; advised
Dick; &ldquo;you are still young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever want to get married,&rdquo;
continued Robin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should only quarrel with my
husband, if I did.&nbsp; And Dick will never do
anything&mdash;not with his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me if I am dull,&rdquo; I pleaded, &ldquo;but
what is the connection between this house, your quarrels with
your husband if you ever get one, and Dick&rsquo;s
head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By way of explanation, Robin sprang to the ground, and before
he could stop her had flung her arms around Dick&rsquo;s
neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help it, Dick dear,&rdquo; she told
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Clever parents always have duffing
children.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ll be of some use in the world after
all, you and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea was that Dick, when he had finished failing in
examinations, should go out to Canada and start a farm, taking
Robin with him.&nbsp; They would breed cattle, and gallop over
the prairies, and camp out in the primeval forest, and slide
about on snow-shoes, and carry canoes on their backs, and shoot
rapids, and stalk things&mdash;so far as I could gather, have a
sort of everlasting Buffalo-Bill&rsquo;s show all to
themselves.&nbsp; How and when the farm work was to get itself
done was not at all clear.&nbsp; The Little Mother and myself
were to end our days with them.&nbsp; We were to sit about in the
sun for a time, and then pass peacefully away.&nbsp; Robin shed a
few tears at this point, but regained her spirits, thinking of
Veronica, who was to be lured out on a visit and married to some
true-hearted yeoman: which is not at present Veronica&rsquo;s
ambition.&nbsp; Veronica&rsquo;s conviction is that she would
look well in a coronet: her own idea is something in the ducal
line.&nbsp; Robina talked for about ten minutes.&nbsp; By the
time she had done she had persuaded Dick that life in the
backwoods of Canada had been his dream from infancy.&nbsp; She is
that sort of girl.</p>
<p>I tried talking reason, but talking to Robin when she has got
a notion in her head is like trying to fix a halter on a
two-year-old colt.&nbsp; This tumble-down, six-roomed cottage was
to be the saving of the family.&nbsp; An ecstatic look
transfigured Robina&rsquo;s face even as she spoke of it.&nbsp;
You might have fancied it a shrine.&nbsp; Robina would do the
cooking.&nbsp; Robina would rise early and milk the cow, and
gather the morning egg.&nbsp; We would lead the simple life,
learn to fend for ourselves.&nbsp; It would be so good for
Veronica.&nbsp; The higher education could wait; let the higher
ideals have a chance.&nbsp; Veronica would make the beds, dust
the rooms.&nbsp; In the evening Veronica, her little basket by
her side, would sit and sew while I talked, telling them things,
and Robina moved softly to and fro about her work, the household
fairy.&nbsp; The Little Mother, whenever strong enough, would
come to us.&nbsp; We would hover round her, tending her with
loving hands.&nbsp; The English farmer must know something, in
spite of all that is said.&nbsp; Dick could arrange for lessons
in practical farming.&nbsp; She did not say it crudely; but
hinted that, surrounded by example, even I might come to take an
interest in honest labour, might end by learning to do something
useful.</p>
<p>Robina talked, I should say, for a quarter of an hour.&nbsp;
By the time she had done, it appeared to me rather a beautiful
idea.&nbsp; Dick&rsquo;s vacation had just commenced.&nbsp; For
the next three months there would be nothing else for him to do
but&mdash;to employ his own expressive phrase&mdash;&ldquo;rot
round.&rdquo;&nbsp; In any event, it would be keeping him out of
mischief.&nbsp; Veronica&rsquo;s governess was leaving.&nbsp;
Veronica&rsquo;s governess generally does leave at the end of
about a year.&nbsp; I think sometimes of advertising for a lady
without a conscience.&nbsp; At the end of a year, they explain to
me that their conscience will not allow them to remain longer;
they do not feel they are earning their salary.&nbsp; It is not
that the child is not a dear child, it is not that she is
stupid.&nbsp; Simply it is&mdash;as a German lady to whom Dick
had been giving what he called finishing lessons in English, once
put it&mdash;that she does not seem to be &ldquo;taking
any.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her mother&rsquo;s idea is that it is
&ldquo;sinking in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps if we allowed Veronica to
lie fallow for awhile, something might show itself.&nbsp; Robina,
speaking for herself, held that a period of quiet usefulness,
away from the society of other silly girls and sillier boys,
would result in her becoming a sensible woman.&nbsp; It is not
often that Robina&rsquo;s yearnings take this direction: to
thwart them, when they did, seemed wrong.</p>
<p>We had some difficulty with the Little Mother.&nbsp; That
these three babies of hers will ever be men and women capable of
running a six-roomed cottage appears to the Little Mother in the
light of a fantastic dream.&nbsp; I explained to her that I
should be there, at all events for two or three days in every
week, to give an eye to things.&nbsp; Even that did not content
her.&nbsp; She gave way eventually on Robina&rsquo;s solemn
undertaking that she should be telegraphed for the first time
Veronica coughed.</p>
<p>On Monday we packed a one-horse van with what we deemed
essential.&nbsp; Dick and Robina rode their bicycles.&nbsp;
Veronica, supported by assorted bedding, made herself comfortable
upon the tailboard.&nbsp; I followed down by train on the
Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the cow that woke me the
first morning.&nbsp; I did not know it was our cow&mdash;not at
the time.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know we had a cow.&nbsp; I looked
at my watch; it was half-past two.&nbsp; I thought maybe she
would go to sleep again, but her idea was that the day had
begun.&nbsp; I went to the window, the moon was at the
full.&nbsp; She was standing by the gate, her head inside the
garden; I took it her anxiety was lest we might miss any of
it.&nbsp; Her neck was stretched out straight, her eyes towards
the sky; which gave to her the appearance of a long-eared
alligator.&nbsp; I have never had much to do with cows.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know how you talk to them.&nbsp; I told her to
&ldquo;be quiet,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;lie down&rdquo;; and made
pretence to throw a boot at her.&nbsp; It seemed to cheer her,
having an audience; she added half a dozen extra notes.&nbsp; I
never knew before a cow had so much in her.&nbsp; There is a
thing one sometimes meets with in the suburbs&mdash;or one used
to; I do not know whether it is still extant, but when I was a
boy it was quite common.&nbsp; It has a hurdy-gurdy fixed to its
waist and a drum strapped on behind, a row of pipes hanging from
its face, and bells and clappers from most of its other
joints.&nbsp; It plays them all at once, and smiles.&nbsp; This
cow reminded me of it&mdash;with organ effects added.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t smile; there was that to be said in her favour.</p>
<p>I hoped that if I made believe to be asleep she would get
discouraged.&nbsp; So I closed the window ostentatiously, and
went back to bed.&nbsp; But it only had the effect of putting her
on her mettle.&nbsp; &ldquo;He did not care for that last,&rdquo;
I imagined her saying to herself, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t at my
best.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t feeling enough in it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She kept it up for about half an hour, and then the gate against
which, I suppose, she had been leaning, gave way with a
crash.&nbsp; That frightened her, and I heard her gallop off
across the field.&nbsp; I was on the point of dozing off again
when a pair of pigeons settled on the window-sill and began to
coo.&nbsp; It is a pretty sound when you are in the mood for
it.&nbsp; I wrote a poem once&mdash;a simple thing, but instinct
with longing&mdash;while sitting under a tree and listening to
the cooing of a pigeon.&nbsp; But that was in the
afternoon.&nbsp; My only longing now was for a gun.&nbsp; Three
times I got out of bed and &ldquo;shoo&rsquo;d&rdquo; them
away.&nbsp; The third time I remained by the window till I had
got it firmly into their heads that I really did not want
them.&nbsp; My behaviour on the former two occasions they had
evidently judged to be mere playfulness.&nbsp; I had just got
back to bed again when an owl began to screech.&nbsp; That is
another sound I used to think attractive&mdash;so weird, so
mysterious.&nbsp; It is Swinburne, I think, who says that you
never get the desired one and the time and the place all right
together.&nbsp; If the beloved one is with you, it is the wrong
place or at the wrong time; and if the time and the place happen
to be right, then it is the party that is wrong.&nbsp; The owl
was all right: I like owls.&nbsp; The place was all right.&nbsp;
He had struck the wrong time, that was all.&nbsp; Eleven
o&rsquo;clock at night, when you can&rsquo;t see him, and
naturally feel that you want to, is the proper time for an
owl.&nbsp; Perched on the roof of a cow-shed in the early dawn he
looks silly.&nbsp; He clung there, flapping his wings and
screeching at the top of his voice.&nbsp; What it was he wanted I
am sure I don&rsquo;t know; and anyhow it didn&rsquo;t seem the
way to get it.&nbsp; He came to this conclusion himself at the
end of twenty minutes, and shut himself up and went home.&nbsp; I
thought I was going to have at last some peace, when a
corncrake&mdash;a creature upon whom Nature has bestowed a song
like to the tearing of calico-sheets mingled with the sharpening
of saws&mdash;settled somewhere in the garden and set to work to
praise its Maker according to its lights.&nbsp; I have a friend,
a poet, who lives just off the Strand, and spends his evenings at
the Garrick Club.&nbsp; He writes occasional verse for the
evening papers, and talks about the &ldquo;silent country, drowsy
with the weight of languors.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of these times
I&rsquo;ll lure him down for a Saturday to Monday and let him
find out what the country really is&mdash;let him hear it.&nbsp;
He is becoming too much of a dreamer: it will do him good, wake
him up a bit.&nbsp; The corncrake after awhile stopped quite
suddenly with a jerk, and for quite five minutes there was
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this continues for another five,&rdquo; I said to
myself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be asleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt it
coming over me.&nbsp; I had hardly murmured the words when the
cow turned up again.&nbsp; I should say she had been somewhere
and had had a drink.&nbsp; She was in better voice than ever.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that this would be an opportunity to make a
few notes on the sunrise.&nbsp; The literary man is looked to for
occasional description of the sunrise.&nbsp; The earnest reader
who has heard about this sunrise thirsts for full
particulars.&nbsp; Myself, for purposes of observation, I have
generally chosen December or the early part of January.&nbsp; But
one never knows.&nbsp; Maybe one of these days I&rsquo;ll want a
summer sunrise, with birds and dew-besprinkled flowers: it goes
well with the rustic heroine, the miller&rsquo;s daughter, or the
girl who brings up chickens and has dreams.&nbsp; I met a brother
author once at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning in Kensington
Gardens.&nbsp; He looked half asleep and so disagreeable that I
hesitated for awhile to speak to him: he is a man that as a rule
breakfasts at eleven.&nbsp; But I summoned my courage and
accosted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is early for you,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early for anyone but a born fool,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I sleep?&rdquo; he retorted
indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I daren&rsquo;t sit down upon a
seat, I daren&rsquo;t lean up against a tree.&nbsp; If I did
I&rsquo;d be asleep in half a second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; I persisted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Been reading Smiles&rsquo;s &lsquo;Self Help and the
Secret of Success&rsquo;?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be absurd,&rdquo; I
advised him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be going to Sunday school
next and keeping a diary.&nbsp; You have left it too late: we
don&rsquo;t reform at forty.&nbsp; Go home and go to
bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could see he was doing himself no good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed for a month when I&rsquo;ve
finished this confounded novel that I&rsquo;m on.&nbsp; Take my
advice,&rdquo; he said&mdash;he laid his hand upon my
shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;Never choose a colonial girl for your
heroine.&nbsp; At our age it is simple madness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fine girl,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;and good.&nbsp; Has a heart of gold.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
wearing me to a shadow.&nbsp; I wanted something fresh and
unconventional.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t grasp what it was going to
do.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the girl that gets up early in the morning
and rides bare-back&mdash;the horse, I mean, of course;
don&rsquo;t be so silly.&nbsp; Over in New South Wales it
didn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; I threw in the usual local
colour&mdash;the eucalyptus-tree and the kangaroo&mdash;and let
her ride.&nbsp; It is now that she is over here in London that I
wish I had never thought of her.&nbsp; She gets up at five and
wanders about the silent city.&nbsp; That means, of course, that
I have to get up at five in order to record her
impressions.&nbsp; I have walked six miles this morning.&nbsp;
First to St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral; she likes it when
there&rsquo;s nobody about.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d think it
wasn&rsquo;t big enough for her to see if anybody else was in the
street.&nbsp; She thinks of it as of a mother watching over her
sleeping children; she&rsquo;s full of all that sort of
thing.&nbsp; And from there to Westminster Bridge.&nbsp; She sits
on the parapet and reads Wordsworth, till the policeman turns her
off.&nbsp; This is another of her favourite spots.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He indicated with a look of concentrated disgust the avenue where
we were standing.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is where she likes to finish
up.&nbsp; She comes here to listen to a blackbird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are through with it now,&rdquo; I said to
console him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it; and it&rsquo;s
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through with it!&rdquo; he laughed bitterly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just beginning it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the
entire East End to be done yet: she&rsquo;s got to meet a fellow
there as big a crank as herself.&nbsp; And walking isn&rsquo;t
the worst.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s going to have a horse; you can guess
what that means.&mdash;Hyde Park will be no good to her.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll find out Richmond and Ham Common.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
got to describe the scenery and the mad joy of the
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you imagine it?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to imagine all the enjoyable part of
it,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must have a groundwork to
go upon.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got to have feelings come to her upon
this horse.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t enter into a rider&rsquo;s
feelings when you&rsquo;ve almost forgotten which side of the
horse you get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I walked with him to the Serpentine.&nbsp; I had been
wondering how it was he had grown stout so suddenly.&nbsp; He had
a bath towel round him underneath his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll give me my death of cold, I know it
will,&rdquo; he chattered while unlacing his boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you leave it till the summer-time,&rdquo; I
suggested, &ldquo;and take her to Ostend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be unconventional,&rdquo; he
growled.&nbsp; &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t take an interest in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do they allow ladies to bathe in the
Serpentine?&rdquo; I persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be the Serpentine,&rdquo; he
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be the Thames at
Greenwich.&nbsp; But it must be the same sort of feeling.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s got to tell them all about it during a lunch in
Queen&rsquo;s Gate, and shock them all.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all
she does it for, in my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He emerged a mottled blue.&nbsp; I helped him into his
clothes, and he was fortunate enough to find an early cab.&nbsp;
The book appeared at Christmas.&nbsp; The critics agreed that the
heroine was a delightful creation.&nbsp; Some of them said they
would like to have known her.</p>
<p>Remembering my poor friend, it occurred to me that by going
out now and making a few notes about the morning, I might be
saving myself trouble later on.&nbsp; I slipped on a few
things&mdash;nothing elaborate&mdash;put a notebook in my pocket,
opened the door and went down.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be more correct to say &ldquo;opened the door
and was down.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was my own fault, I admit.&nbsp; We
had talked this thing over before going to bed, and I myself had
impressed upon Veronica the need for caution.&nbsp; The architect
of the country cottage does not waste space.&nbsp; He dispenses
with landings; the bedroom door opens on to the top stair.&nbsp;
It does not do to walk out of your bedroom, for the reason there
is nothing outside to walk on.&nbsp; I had said to Veronica,
pointing out this fact to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t, in the morning, come bursting out of
the room in your usual volcanic style, because if you do there
will be trouble.&nbsp; As you perceive, there is no
landing.&nbsp; The stairs commence at once; they are steep, and
they lead down to a brick floor.&nbsp; Open the door quietly,
look where you are going, and step carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had added his advice to mine.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did that
myself the first morning,&rdquo; Dick had said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
stepped straight out of the bedroom into the kitchen; and I can
tell you, it hurts.&nbsp; You be careful, young &rsquo;un.&nbsp;
This cottage doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to dash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina had fallen down with a tray in her hand.&nbsp; She said
that never should she forget the horror of that moment, when,
sitting on the kitchen floor, she had cried to Dick&mdash;her own
voice sounding to her as if it came from somewhere quite far off:
&ldquo;Is it broken?&nbsp; Tell me the truth.&nbsp; Is it broken
anywhere?&rdquo; and Dick had replied: &ldquo;Broken! why,
it&rsquo;s smashed to atoms.&nbsp; What did you
expect?&rdquo;&nbsp; Robina had asked the question with reference
to her head, while Dick had thought she was alluding to the
teapot.&nbsp; In that moment, had said Robina, her whole life had
passed before her.&nbsp; She let Veronica feel the bump.</p>
<p>Veronica was disappointed with the bump, having expected
something bigger, but had promised to be careful.&nbsp; We had
all agreed that if in spite of our warnings she forgot, and came
blundering down in the morning, it would serve her right.&nbsp;
It was thinking of all this that, as I lay upon the floor, made
me feel angry with everybody.&nbsp; I hate people who can sleep
through noises that wake me up.&nbsp; Why was I the only person
in the house to be disturbed?&nbsp; Dick&rsquo;s room was round
the corner; there was some excuse for him.&nbsp; But Robina and
Veronica&rsquo;s window looked straight down upon the cow.&nbsp;
If Robina and Veronica were not a couple of logs, the cow would
have aroused them.&nbsp; We should have discussed the matter with
the door ajar.&nbsp; Robina would have said, &ldquo;Whatever you
do, be careful of the stairs, Pa,&rdquo; and I should have
remembered.&nbsp; The modern child appears to me to have no
feeling for its parent.</p>
<p>I picked myself up and started for the door.&nbsp; The cow
continued bellowing steadily.&nbsp; My whole anxiety was to get
to her quickly and to hit her.&nbsp; But the door took more
finding than I could have believed possible.&nbsp; The shutters
were closed and the whole place was in pitch darkness.&nbsp; The
idea had been to furnish this cottage only with things that were
absolutely necessary, but the room appeared to me to be
overcrowded.&nbsp; There was a milking-stool, which is a thing
made purposely heavy so that it may not be easily upset.&nbsp; If
I tumbled over it once I tumbled over it a dozen times.&nbsp; I
got hold of it at last and carried it about with me.&nbsp; I
thought I would use it to hit the cow&mdash;that is, when I had
found the front-door.&nbsp; I knew it led out of the parlour, but
could not recollect its exact position.&nbsp; I argued that if I
kept along the wall I should be bound to come to it.&nbsp; I
found the wall, and set off full of hope.&nbsp; I suppose the
explanation was that, without knowing it, I must have started
with the door, not the front-door, the other door, leading into
the kitchen.&nbsp; I crept along, carefully feeling my way, and
struck quite new things altogether&mdash;things I had no
recollection of and that hit me in fresh places.&nbsp; I climbed
over what I presumed to be a beer-barrel and landed among
bottles; there were dozens upon dozens of them.&nbsp; To get away
from these bottles I had to leave the wall; but I found it again,
as I thought, and I felt along it for another half a dozen yards
or so and then came again upon bottles: the room appeared to be
paved with bottles.&nbsp; A little farther on I rolled over
another beer-barrel: as a matter of fact it was the same
beer-barrel, but I did not know this.&nbsp; At the time it seemed
to me that Robina had made up her mind to run a
public-house.&nbsp; I found the milking-stool again and started
afresh, and before I had gone a dozen steps was in among bottles
again.&nbsp; Later on, in the broad daylight, it was easy enough
to understand what had happened.&nbsp; I had been carefully
feeling my way round and round a screen.&nbsp; I got so sick of
these bottles and so tired of rolling over these everlasting
beer-barrels, that I abandoned the wall and plunged boldly into
space.</p>
<p>I had barely started, when, looking up, I saw the sky above
me: a star was twinkling just above my head.&nbsp; Had I been
wide awake, and had the cow stopped bellowing for just one
minute, I should have guessed that somehow or another I had got
into a chimney.&nbsp; But as things were, the wonder and the
mystery of it all appalled me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alice&rsquo;s
Adventures in Wonderland&rdquo; would have appeared to me, at
that moment, in the nature of a guide to travellers.&nbsp; Had a
rocking-horse or a lobster suddenly appeared to me I should have
sat and talked to it; and if it had not answered me I should have
thought it sulky and been hurt.&nbsp; I took a step forward and
the star disappeared, just as if somebody had blown it out.&nbsp;
I was not surprised in the least.&nbsp; I was expecting anything
to happen.</p>
<p>I found a door and it opened quite easily.&nbsp; A wood was in
front of me.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t see any cow anywhere, but I
still heard her.&nbsp; It all seemed quite natural.&nbsp; I would
wander into the wood; most likely I should meet her there, and
she would be smoking a pipe.&nbsp; In all probability she would
know some poetry.</p>
<p>With the fresh air my senses gradually came back to me, and I
began to understand why it was I could not see the cow.&nbsp; The
reason was that the house was between us.&nbsp; By some
mysterious process I had been discharged into the back
garden.&nbsp; I still had the milking-stool in my hand, but the
cow no longer troubled me.&nbsp; Let her see if she could wake
Veronica by merely bellowing outside the door; it was more than I
had ever been able to do.</p>
<p>I sat down on the stool and opened my note-book.&nbsp; I
headed the page: &ldquo;Sunrise in July: observations and
emotions,&rdquo; and I wrote down at once, lest I should forget
it, that towards three o&rsquo;clock a faint light is
discernible, and added that this light gets stronger as the time
goes on.</p>
<p>It sounded footling even to myself, but I had been reading a
novel of the realistic school that had been greatly praised for
its actuality.&nbsp; There is a demand in some quarters for this
class of observation.&nbsp; I likewise made a note that the
pigeon and the corncrake appear to be among the earliest of
Nature&rsquo;s children to welcome the coming day; and added that
the screech-owl may be heard, perhaps at its best, by anyone
caring to rise for the purpose, some quarter of an hour before
the dawn.&nbsp; That was all I could think of just then.&nbsp; As
regards emotions, I did not seem to have any.</p>
<p>I lit a pipe and waited for the sun.&nbsp; The sky in front of
me was tinged with a faint pink.&nbsp; Every moment it flushed a
deeper red.&nbsp; I maintain that anyone, not an expert, would
have said that was the portion of the horizon on which to keep
one&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; I kept my eye upon it, but no sun
appeared.&nbsp; I lit another pipe.&nbsp; The sky in front of me
was now a blaze of glory.&nbsp; I scribbled a few lines, likening
the scattered clouds to brides blushing at the approach of the
bridegroom.&nbsp; That would have been all right if later on they
hadn&rsquo;t begun to turn green: it seemed the wrong colour for
a bride.&nbsp; Later on still they went yellow, and that spoilt
the simile past hope.&nbsp; One cannot wax poetical about a bride
who at the approach of the bridegroom turns first green and then
yellow: you can only feel sorry for her.&nbsp; I waited some
more.&nbsp; The sky in front of me grew paler every moment.&nbsp;
I began to fear that something had happened to that sun.&nbsp; If
I hadn&rsquo;t known so much astronomy I should have said that he
had changed his mind and had gone back again.&nbsp; I rose with
the idea of seeing into things.&nbsp; He had been up apparently
for hours: he had got up at the back of me.&nbsp; It seemed to be
nobody&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; I put my pipe into my pocket and
strolled round to the front.&nbsp; The cow was still there; she
was pleased to see me, and started bellowing again.</p>
<p>I heard a sound of whistling.&nbsp; It proceeded from a
farmer&rsquo;s boy.&nbsp; I hailed him, and he climbed a gate and
came to me across the field.&nbsp; He was a cheerful youth.&nbsp;
He nodded to the cow and hoped she had had a good night: he
pronounced it &ldquo;nihet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the cow?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t
precisely move in the sime set.&nbsp; Sort o&rsquo; business
relytionship more like&mdash;if you understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something about this boy was worrying me.&nbsp; He did not
seem like a real farmer&rsquo;s boy.&nbsp; But then nothing
seemed quite real this morning.&nbsp; My feeling was to let
things go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose cow is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He stared at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know to whom it belongs,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want to restore it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;but where do you
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was making me cross.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where do I live?&rdquo; I
retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, in this cottage.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve got up early and come from a
distance to listen to this cow?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk so
much.&nbsp; Do you know whose cow it is, or don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your cow,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>It was my turn to stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t got a cow,&rdquo; I told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yus you have,&rdquo; he persisted; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
got that cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had stopped bellowing for a moment.&nbsp; She was not the
cow I felt I could ever take a pride in.&nbsp; At some time or
another, quite recently, she must have sat down in some mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did I get her?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lydy,&rdquo; explained the boy, &ldquo;she
came rahnd to our plice on Tuesday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to see light.&nbsp; &ldquo;An excitable young
lady&mdash;talks very fast&mdash;never waits for the
answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With jolly fine eyes,&rdquo; added the boy
approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she ordered a cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t seem to &rsquo;ave strength enough to live
another dy withaht it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any stipulation made concerning the price of the
cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady with the eyes&mdash;did she think to ask
the price of the cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sordid details was entered into, so far as I could
&rsquo;ear,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>
<p>They would not have been&mdash;by Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any hint let fall as to what the cow was wanted
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lydy gives us to understand,&rdquo; said the boy,
&ldquo;that fresh milk was &rsquo;er idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That surprised me: that was thoughtful of Robina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And this is the cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I towed her rahnd last night.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
knock at the door and tell yer abaht &rsquo;er, cos, to be quite
frank with yer, there wasn&rsquo;t anybody in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is she bellowing for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only a
theory, o&rsquo; course, but I should sy, from the look of
&rsquo;er, that she wanted to be milked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it started bellowing at half-past two,&rdquo; I
argued.&nbsp; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t expect to be milked at
half-past two, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meself,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given up
looking for sense in cows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In some unaccountable way this boy was hypnotising me.&nbsp;
Everything had suddenly become out of place.</p>
<p>The cow had suddenly become absurd: she ought to have been a
milk-can.&nbsp; The wood struck me as neglected: there ought to
have been notice-boards about, &ldquo;Keep off the Grass,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Smoking Strictly Prohibited&rdquo;: there wasn&rsquo;t a
seat to be seen.&nbsp; The cottage had surely got itself there by
accident: where was the street?&nbsp; The birds were all out of
their cages; everything was upside down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a real farmer&rsquo;s boy?&rdquo; I asked
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course I am,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do yer tike me for&mdash;a hartist in
disguise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It came to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Enery&mdash;&rsquo;Enery
&rsquo;Opkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you born?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Camden Tahn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was a nice beginning to a rural life!&nbsp; What place
could be the country while this boy Hopkins was about?&nbsp; He
would have given to the Garden of Eden the atmosphere of an
outlying suburb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to earn an occasional shilling?&rdquo; I
put it to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather it come reggler,&rdquo; said
Hopkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;Better for me kerrickter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You drop that Cockney accent and learn Berkshire, and
I&rsquo;ll give you half a sovereign when you can talk it,&rdquo;
I promised him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, for instance, say
&lsquo;ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&rdquo; I explained to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Say &lsquo;bain&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say
&lsquo;The young lydy, she came rahnd to our plice;&rsquo; say
&lsquo;The missy, &rsquo;er coomed down; &rsquo;er coomed, and
&rsquo;er ses to the maister, &rsquo;er ses . . . &rsquo;&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the sort of thing I want to surround myself with
here.&nbsp; When you informed me that the cow was mine, you
should have said: &lsquo;Whoi, &rsquo;er be your cow, surelie
&rsquo;er be.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s Berkshire?&rdquo; demanded
Hopkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re confident about
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a type that is by nature
suspicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be Berkshire pure and undefiled,&rdquo; I
admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is what in literature we term
&lsquo;dialect.&rsquo;&nbsp; It does for most places outside the
twelve-mile radius.&nbsp; The object is to convey a feeling of
rustic simplicity.&nbsp; Anyhow, it isn&rsquo;t Camden
Town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started him with a shilling then and there to encourage
him.&nbsp; He promised to come round in the evening for one or
two books, written by friends of mine, that I reckoned would be
of help to him; and I returned to the cottage and set to work to
rouse Robina.&nbsp; Her tone was apologetic.&nbsp; She had got
the notion into her head that I had been calling her for quite a
long time.&nbsp; I explained that this was not the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How funny!&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said to
Veronica more than an hour ago: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure
that&rsquo;s Pa calling us.&rsquo;&nbsp; I suppose I must have
been dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t dream any more,&rdquo; I
suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come down and see to this confounded cow
of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Veronica, &ldquo;has it
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has come,&rdquo; I told her.&nbsp; &ldquo;As a
matter of fact, it has been here some time.&nbsp; It ought to
have been milked four hours ago, according to its own
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina said she would be down in a minute.</p>
<p>She was down in twenty-five, which was sooner than I had
expected.&nbsp; She brought Veronica with her.&nbsp; She said she
would have been down sooner if she had not waited for
Veronica.&nbsp; It appeared that this was just precisely what
Veronica had been telling her.&nbsp; I was feeling
irritable.&nbsp; I had been up half a day, and hadn&rsquo;t had
my breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand there arguing,&rdquo; I told
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake let&rsquo;s get to
work and milk this cow.&nbsp; We shall have the poor creature
dying on our hands if we&rsquo;re not careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina was wandering round the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t come across a milking-stool anywhere,
have you, Pa?&rdquo; asked Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come across your milking-stool, I estimate, some
thirteen times,&rdquo; I told her.&nbsp; I fetched it from where
I had left it, and gave it to her; and we filed out in
procession; Veronica with a galvanised iron bucket bringing up
the rear.</p>
<p>The problem that was forcing itself upon my mind was: did
Robina know how to milk a cow?&nbsp; Robina, I argued, the idea
once in her mind, would immediately have ordered a cow,
clamouring for it&mdash;as Hopkins had picturesquely expressed
it&mdash;as though she had not strength to live another day
without a cow.&nbsp; Her next proceeding would have been to buy a
milking-stool.&nbsp; It was a tasteful milking-stool, this one
she had selected, ornamented with the rough drawing of a cow in
poker work: a little too solid for my taste, but one that I
should say would wear well.&nbsp; The pail she had not as yet had
time to see about.&nbsp; This galvanised bucket we were using
was, I took it, a temporary makeshift.&nbsp; When Robina had
leisure she would go into the town and purchase something at an
art stores.&nbsp; That, to complete the scheme, she would have
done well to have taken a few practical lessons in milking would
come to her, as an inspiration, with the arrival of the
cow.&nbsp; I noticed that Robina&rsquo;s steps as we approached
the cow were less elastic.&nbsp; Just outside the cow Robina
halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Robina, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
only one way of milking a cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be fancy ways,&rdquo; I answered,
&ldquo;necessary to you if later on you think of entering a
competition.&nbsp; This morning, seeing we are late, I
shouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about style.&nbsp; If I were you,
this morning I should adopt the ordinary unimaginative method,
and aim only at results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina sat down and placed her bucket underneath the cow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Robina, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t
matter which&mdash;which one I begin with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was perfectly plain she hadn&rsquo;t the least notion how
to milk a cow.&nbsp; I told her so, adding comments.&nbsp; Now
and then a little fatherly talk does good.&nbsp; As a rule I have
to work myself up for these occasions.&nbsp; This morning I was
feeling fairly fit: things had conspired to this end.&nbsp; I put
before Robina the aims and privileges of the household fairy as
they appeared, not to her, but to me.&nbsp; I also confided to
Veronica the result of many weeks&rsquo; reflections concerning
her and her behaviour.&nbsp; I also told them both what I thought
about Dick.&nbsp; I do this sort of thing once every six months:
it has an excellent effect for about three days.</p>
<p>Robina wiped away her tears, and seized the first one that
came to her hand.&nbsp; The cow, without saying a word, kicked
over the empty bucket, and walked away, disgust expressed in
every hair of her body.&nbsp; Robina, crying quietly, followed
her.&nbsp; By patting her on her neck, and letting her wipe her
nose upon my coat&mdash;which seemed to comfort her&mdash;I
persuaded her to keep still while Robina worked for ten minutes
at high pressure.&nbsp; The result was about a glassful and a
half, the cow&rsquo;s capacity, to all appearance, being by this
time some five or six gallons.</p>
<p>Robina broke down, and acknowledged she had been a wicked
girl.&nbsp; If the cow died, so she said, she should never
forgive herself.&nbsp; Veronica at this burst into tears also;
and the cow, whether moved afresh by her own troubles or by
theirs, commenced again to bellow.&nbsp; I was fortunately able
to find an elderly labourer smoking a pipe and eating bacon
underneath a tree; and with him I bargained that for a shilling a
day he should milk the cow till further notice.</p>
<p>We left him busy, and returned to the cottage.&nbsp; Dick met
us at the door with a cheery &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
wanted to know if we had heard the storm.&nbsp; He also wanted to
know when breakfast would be ready.&nbsp; Robina thought that
happy event would be shortly after he had boiled the kettle and
made the tea and fried the bacon, while Veronica was laying the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina said that if he dared to mention the word
&ldquo;household-fairy&rdquo; she would box his ears, and go
straight up to bed, and leave everybody to do everything.&nbsp;
She said she meant it.</p>
<p>Dick has one virtue: it is philosophy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on,
young &rsquo;un,&rdquo; said Dick to Veronica.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Trouble is good for us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us,&rdquo; said Veronica, &ldquo;it makes
bitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We sat down to breakfast at eight-thirty.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> architect arrived on Friday
afternoon, or rather, his assistant.</p>
<p>I felt from the first I was going to like him.&nbsp; He is
shy, and that, of course, makes him appear awkward.&nbsp; But, as
I explained to Robina, it is the shy young men who, generally
speaking, turn out best: few men could have been more painfully
shy up to twenty-five than myself.</p>
<p>Robina said that was different: in the case of an author it
did not matter.&nbsp; Robina&rsquo;s attitude towards the
literary profession would not annoy me so much were it not
typical.&nbsp; To be a literary man is, in Robina&rsquo;s
opinion, to be a licensed idiot.&nbsp; It was only a week or two
ago that I overheard from my study window a conversation between
Veronica and Robina upon this very point.&nbsp; Veronica&rsquo;s
eye had caught something lying on the grass.&nbsp; I could not
myself see what it was, in consequence of an intervening laurel
bush.&nbsp; Veronica stooped down and examined it with
care.&nbsp; The next instant, uttering a piercing whoop, she
leapt into the air; then, clapping her hands, began to
dance.&nbsp; Her face was radiant with a holy joy.&nbsp; Robina,
passing near, stopped and demanded explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&rsquo;s tennis racket!&rdquo; shouted
Veronica&mdash;Veronica never sees the use of talking in an
ordinary tone of voice when shouting will do just as well.&nbsp;
She continued clapping her hands and taking little bounds into
the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you going on like that for?&rdquo; asked
Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t bit you, has it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been out all night in the wet,&rdquo;
shouted Veronica.&nbsp; &ldquo;He forgot to bring it
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wicked child!&rdquo; said Robina severely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to be pleased about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; explained Veronica.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thought at first it was mine.&nbsp; Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t there have
been a talk about it, if it had been!&nbsp; Oh my! wouldn&rsquo;t
there have been a row!&rdquo;&nbsp; She settled down to a steady
rhythmic dance, suggestive of a Greek chorus expressing
satisfaction with the gods.</p>
<p>Robina seized her by the shoulders and shook her back into
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it had been yours,&rdquo; said Robina,
&ldquo;you would deserve to have been sent to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, why don&rsquo;t he go to bed?&rdquo; argued
Veronica.</p>
<p>Robina took her by the arm and walked her up and down just
underneath my window.&nbsp; I listened, because the conversation
interested me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa, as I am always explaining to you,&rdquo; said
Robina, &ldquo;is a literary man.&nbsp; He cannot help forgetting
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t help forgetting things,&rdquo;
insisted Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You find it hard,&rdquo; explained Robina kindly;
&ldquo;but if you keep on trying you will succeed.&nbsp; You will
get more thoughtful.&nbsp; I used to be forgetful and do foolish
things once, when I was a little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing for us if we was all literary,&rdquo;
suggested Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we &lsquo;were&rsquo; all literary,&rdquo; Robina
corrected her.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you see we are not.&nbsp; You and
I and Dick, we are just ordinary mortals.&nbsp; We must try and
think, and be sensible.&nbsp; In the same way, when Pa gets
excited and raves&mdash;I mean, seems to rave&mdash;it&rsquo;s
the literary temperament.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t help
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you help doing anything when you are
literary?&rdquo; asked Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal you can&rsquo;t help,&rdquo;
answered Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair to judge them
by the ordinary standard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drifted towards the kitchen garden&mdash;it was the time
of strawberries&mdash;and the remainder of the talk I lost.&nbsp;
I noticed that for some days afterwards Veronica displayed a
tendency to shutting herself up in the schoolroom with a
copybook, and that lead pencils had a way of disappearing from my
desk.&nbsp; One in particular that had suited me I determined if
possible to recover.&nbsp; A subtle instinct guided me to
Veronica&rsquo;s sanctum.&nbsp; I found her thoughtfully sucking
it.&nbsp; She explained to me that she was writing a little
play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get things from your father, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; she enquired of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do,&rdquo; I admitted; &ldquo;but you ought not to
take them without asking.&nbsp; I am always telling you of
it.&nbsp; That pencil is the only one I can write
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean the pencil,&rdquo; explained
Veronica.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was wondering if I had got your literary
temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is puzzling, when you come to think of it, this estimate
accorded by the general public to the
<i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>.&nbsp; It stands to reason that the man
who writes books, explaining everything and putting everybody
right, must be himself an exceptionally clever man; else how
could he do it!&nbsp; The thing is pure logic.&nbsp; Yet to
listen to Robina and her like you might think we had not sense
enough to run ourselves, as the saying is&mdash;let alone running
the universe.&nbsp; If I would let her, Robina would sit and give
me information by the hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ordinary girl . . . &rdquo; Robina will begin, with
the air of a University Extension Lecturer.</p>
<p>It is so exasperating.&nbsp; As if I did not know all there is
to be known about girls!&nbsp; Why, it is my business.&nbsp; I
point this out to Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Robina will answer sweetly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I was meaning the real girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would make not the slightest difference were I even quite a
high-class literary man&mdash;Robina thinks I am: she is a dear
child.&nbsp; Were I Shakespeare himself, and could I in
consequence say to her: &ldquo;Methinks, child, the creator of
Ophelia and Juliet, and Rosamund and Beatrice, must surely know
something about girls,&rdquo; Robina would still make answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Pa dear.&nbsp; Everybody knows how clever
you are.&nbsp; But I was thinking for the moment of real
girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wonder to myself sometimes, Is literature to the general
reader ever anything more than a fairy-tale?&nbsp; We write with
our heart&rsquo;s blood, as we put it.&nbsp; We ask our
conscience, Is it right thus to lay bare the secrets of our
souls?&nbsp; The general reader does not grasp that we are
writing with our heart&rsquo;s blood: to him it is just
ink.&nbsp; He does not believe we are laying bare the secrets of
our souls: he takes it we are just pretending.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once
upon a time there lived a girl named Angelina who loved a party
by the name of Edwin.&rdquo;&nbsp; He imagines&mdash;he, the
general reader&mdash;when we tell him all the wonderful thoughts
that were inside Angelina, that it was we who put them
there.&nbsp; He does not know, he will not try to understand,
that Angelina is in reality more real than is Miss Jones, who
rides up every morning in the &rsquo;bus with him, and has a
pretty knack of rendering conversation about the weather novel
and suggestive.&nbsp; As a boy I won some popularity among my
schoolmates as a teller of stories.&nbsp; One afternoon, to a
small collection with whom I was homing across Regent&rsquo;s
Park, I told the story of a beautiful Princess.&nbsp; But she was
not the ordinary Princess.&nbsp; She would not behave as a
Princess should.&nbsp; I could not help it.&nbsp; The others
heard only my voice, but I was listening to the wind.&nbsp; She
thought she loved the Prince&mdash;until he had wounded the
Dragon unto death and had carried her away into the wood.&nbsp;
Then, while the Prince lay sleeping, she heard the Dragon calling
to her in its pain, and crept back to where it lay bleeding, and
put her arms about its scaly neck and kissed it; and that healed
it.&nbsp; I was hoping myself that at this point it would turn
into a prince itself, but it didn&rsquo;t; it just remained a
dragon&mdash;so the wind said.&nbsp; Yet the Princess loved it:
it wasn&rsquo;t half a bad dragon, when you knew it.&nbsp; I
could not tell them what became of the Prince: the wind
didn&rsquo;t seem to care a hang about the Prince.</p>
<p>Myself, I liked the story, but Hocker, who was a Fifth Form
boy, voicing our little public, said it was rot, so far, and that
I had got to hurry up and finish things rightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is all,&rdquo; I told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Hocker.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got to marry the Prince in the end.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll have to kill the Dragon again; and mind he does it
properly this time.&nbsp; Whoever heard of a Princess leaving a
Prince for a Dragon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she wasn&rsquo;t the ordinary sort of
Princess,&rdquo; I argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;s got to be,&rdquo; criticised
Hocker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you give yourself so many
airs.&nbsp; You make her marry the Prince, and be slippy about
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to catch the four-fifteen from Chalk
Farm station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I persisted
obstinately.&nbsp; &ldquo;She married the Dragon and lived happy
ever afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hocker adopted sterner measures.&nbsp; He seized my arm and
twisted it behind me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She married who?&rdquo; demanded Hocker: grammar was
not Hocker&rsquo;s strong point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dragon,&rdquo; I growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She married who?&rdquo; repeated Hocker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dragon,&rdquo; I whined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She married who?&rdquo; for the third time urged
Hocker.</p>
<p>Hocker was strong, and the tears were forcing themselves into
my eyes in spite of me.&nbsp; So the Princess in return for
healing the Dragon made it promise to reform.&nbsp; It went back
with her to the Prince, and made itself generally useful to both
of them for the rest of the tour.&nbsp; And the Prince took the
Princess home with him and married her; and the Dragon died and
was buried.&nbsp; The others liked the story better, but I hated
it; and the wind sighed and died away.</p>
<p>The little crowd becomes the reading public, and Hocker grows
into an editor; he twists my arm in other ways.&nbsp; Some are
brave, so the crowd kicks them and scurries off to catch the
four-fifteen.&nbsp; But most of us, I fear, are slaves to
Hocker.&nbsp; Then, after awhile, the wind grows sulky and will
not tell us stories any more, and we have to make them up out of
our own heads.&nbsp; Perhaps it is just as well.&nbsp; What were
doors and windows made for but to keep out the wind.</p>
<p>He is a dangerous fellow, this wandering Wind; he leads me
astray.&nbsp; I was talking about our architect.</p>
<p>He made a bad start, so far as Robina was concerned, by coming
in at the back-door.&nbsp; Robina, in a big apron, was washing
up.&nbsp; He apologised for having blundered into the kitchen,
and offered to go out again and work round to the front.&nbsp;
Robina replied, with unnecessary severity as I thought, that an
architect, if anyone, might have known the difference between the
right side of a house and the wrong; but presumed that youth and
inexperience could always be pleaded as excuse for
stupidity.&nbsp; I cannot myself see why Robina should have been
so much annoyed.&nbsp; Labour, as Robina had been explaining to
Veronica only a few hours before, exalts a woman.&nbsp; In olden
days, ladies&mdash;the highest in the land&mdash;were proud, not
ashamed, of their ability to perform domestic duties.&nbsp; This,
later on, I pointed out to Robina.&nbsp; Her answer was that in
olden days you didn&rsquo;t have chits of boys going about,
calling themselves architects, and opening back-doors without
knocking; or if they did knock, knocking so that nobody on earth
could hear them.</p>
<p>Robina wiped her hands on the towel behind the door, and
brought him into the front-room, where she announced him, coldly,
as &ldquo;The young man from the architect&rsquo;s
office.&rdquo;&nbsp; He explained&mdash;but quite
modestly&mdash;that he was not exactly Messrs. Spreight&rsquo;s
young man, but an architect himself, a junior member of the
firm.&nbsp; To make it clear he produced his card, which was that
of Mr. Archibald T. Bute, F.R.I.B.A.&nbsp; Practically speaking,
all this was unnecessary.&nbsp; Through the open door I had, of
course, heard every word; and old Spreight had told me of his
intention to send me one of his most promising assistants, who
would be able to devote himself entirely to my work.&nbsp; I put
matters right by introducing him formally to Robina.&nbsp; They
bowed to one another rather stiffly.&nbsp; Robina said that if he
would excuse her she would return to her work; and he answered
&ldquo;Charmed,&rdquo; and also that he didn&rsquo;t mean
it.&nbsp; As I have tried to get it into Robina&rsquo;s head, the
young fellow was confused.&nbsp; He had meant&mdash;it was
self-evident&mdash;that he was charmed at being introduced to
her, not at her desire to return to the kitchen.&nbsp; But Robina
appears to have taken a dislike to him.</p>
<p>I gave him a cigar, and we started for the house.&nbsp; It
lies just a mile from this cottage, the other side of the
wood.&nbsp; One excellent trait in him I soon discovered&mdash;he
is intelligent without knowing everything.</p>
<p>I confess it to my shame, but the young man who knows
everything has come to pall upon me.&nbsp; According to Emerson,
this is a proof of my own intellectual feebleness.&nbsp; The
strong man, intellectually, cultivates the society of his
superiors.&nbsp; He wants to get on, he wants to learn
things.&nbsp; If I loved knowledge as one should, I would have no
one but young men about me.&nbsp; There was a friend of
Dick&rsquo;s, a gentleman from Rugby.&nbsp; At one time he had
hopes of me; I felt he had.&nbsp; But he was too impatient.&nbsp;
He tried to bring me on too quickly.&nbsp; You must take into
consideration natural capacity.&nbsp; After listening to him for
an hour or two my mind would wander.&nbsp; I could not help
it.&nbsp; The careless laughter of uninformed middle-aged
gentlemen and ladies would creep to me from the croquet lawn or
from the billiard-room.&nbsp; I longed to be among them.&nbsp;
Sometimes I would battle with my lower nature.&nbsp; What did
they know?&nbsp; What could they tell me?&nbsp; More often I
would succumb.&nbsp; There were occasions when I used to get up
and go away from him, quite suddenly.</p>
<p>I talked with young Bute during our walk about domestic
architecture in general.&nbsp; He said he should describe the
present tendency in domestic architecture as towards
corners.&nbsp; The desire of the British public was to go into a
corner and live.&nbsp; A lady for whose husband his firm had
lately built a house in Surrey had propounded to him a problem in
connection with this point.&nbsp; She agreed it was a charming
house; no house in Surrey had more corners, and that was saying
much.&nbsp; But she could not see how for the future she was
going to bring up her children.&nbsp; She was a humanely minded
lady.&nbsp; Hitherto she had punished them, when needful, by
putting them in the corner; the shame of it had always exercised
upon them a salutary effect.&nbsp; But in the new house corners
are reckoned the prime parts of every room.&nbsp; It is the
honoured guest who is sent into the corner.&nbsp; The father has
a corner sacred to himself, with high up above his head a
complicated cupboard, wherein with the help of a step-ladder, he
may keep his pipes and his tobacco, and thus by slow degrees cure
himself of the habit of smoking.&nbsp; The mother likewise has
her corner, where stands her spinning-wheel, in case the idea
comes to her to weave sheets and underclothing.&nbsp; It also has
a book-shelf supporting thirteen volumes, arranged in a sloping
position to look natural; the last one maintained at its angle of
forty-five degrees by a ginger-jar in old blue Nankin.&nbsp; You
are not supposed to touch them, because that would disarrange
them.&nbsp; Besides which, fooling about, you might upset the
ginger-jar.&nbsp; The consequence of all this is the corner is no
longer disgraceful.&nbsp; The parent can no more say to the
erring child:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wicked boy!&nbsp; Go into the cosy corner this very
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the house of the future the place of punishment will have
to be the middle of the room.&nbsp; The angry mother will
exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you answer me, you saucy minx!&nbsp; You go
straight into the middle of the room, and don&rsquo;t you dare to
come out of it till I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The difficulty with the artistic house is finding the right
people to put into it.&nbsp; In the picture the artistic room
never has anybody in it.&nbsp; There is a strip of art embroidery
upon the table, together with a bowl of roses.&nbsp; Upon the
ancient high-backed settee lies an item of fancy work,
unfinished&mdash;just as she left it.&nbsp; In the
&ldquo;study&rdquo; an open book, face downwards, has been left
on a chair.&nbsp; It is the last book he was reading&mdash;it has
never been disturbed.&nbsp; A pipe of quaint design is cold upon
the lintel of the lattice window.&nbsp; No one will ever smoke
that pipe again: it must have been difficult to smoke at any
time.&nbsp; The sight of the artistic room, as depicted in the
furniture catalogue, always brings tears to my eyes.&nbsp; People
once inhabited these rooms, read there those old volumes bound in
vellum, smoked&mdash;or tried to smoke&mdash;these impracticable
pipes; white hands, that someone maybe had loved to kiss, once
fluttered among the folds of these unfinished antimacassars, or
Berlin wool-work slippers, and went away, leaving the things
about.</p>
<p>One takes it that the people who once occupied these artistic
rooms are now all dead.&nbsp; This was their
&ldquo;Dining-Room.&rdquo;&nbsp; They sat on those artistic
chairs.&nbsp; They could hardly have used the dinner service set
out upon the Elizabethan dresser, because that would have left
the dresser bare: one assumes they had an extra service for use,
or else that they took their meals in the kitchen.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Entrance Hall&rdquo; is a singularly chaste
apartment.&nbsp; There is no necessity for a door-mat: people
with muddy boots, it is to be presumed, were sent round to the
back.&nbsp; A riding-cloak, the relic apparently of a highwayman,
hangs behind the door.&nbsp; It is the sort of cloak you would
expect to find there&mdash;a decorative cloak.&nbsp; An umbrella
or a waterproof cape would be fatal to the whole effect.</p>
<p>Now and again the illustrator of the artistic room will permit
a young girl to come and sit there.&nbsp; But she has to be a
very carefully selected girl.&nbsp; To begin with, she has got to
look and dress as though she had been born at least three hundred
years ago.&nbsp; She has got to have that sort of clothes, and
she has got to have her hair done just that way.</p>
<p>She has got to look sad; a cheerful girl in the artistic room
would jar one&rsquo;s artistic sense.&nbsp; One imagines the
artist consulting with the proud possessor of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got such a thing as a miserable
daughter, have you?&nbsp; Some fairly good-looking girl who has
been crossed in love, or is misunderstood.&nbsp; Because if so,
you might dress her up in something out of the local museum and
send her along.&nbsp; A little thing like that gives
verisimilitude to a design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She must not touch anything.&nbsp; All she may do is to read a
book&mdash;not really read it, that would suggest too much life
and movement: she sits with the book in her lap and gazes into
the fire, if it happens to be the dining-room: or out of the
window if it happens to be a morning-room, and the architect
wishes to call attention to the window-seat.&nbsp; Nothing of the
male species, as far as I have been able to ascertain, has ever
entered these rooms.&nbsp; I once thought I had found a man who
had been allowed into his own &ldquo;Smoking-Den,&rdquo; but on
closer examination it turned out he was only a portrait.</p>
<p>Sometimes one is given &ldquo;Vistas.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doors stand
open, and you can see right away through &ldquo;The Nook&rdquo;
into the garden.&nbsp; There is never a living soul about the
place.&nbsp; The whole family has been sent out for a walk or
locked up in the cellars.&nbsp; This strikes you as odd until you
come to think the matter out.&nbsp; The modern man and woman is
not artistic.&nbsp; I am not artistic&mdash;not what I call
really artistic.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t go well with Gobelin
tapestry and warming-pans.&nbsp; I feel I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Robina is not artistic, not in that sense.&nbsp; I tried her once
with a harpsichord I picked up cheap in Wardour Street, and a
reproduction of a Roman stool.&nbsp; The thing was an utter
failure.&nbsp; A cottage piano, with a photo-frame and a fern
upon, it is what the soul cries out for in connection with
Robina.&nbsp; Dick is not artistic.&nbsp; Dick does not go with
peacocks&rsquo; feathers and guitars.&nbsp; I can see Dick with a
single peacock&rsquo;s feather at St. Giles&rsquo;s Fair, when
the bulldogs are not looking; but the decorative panel of
peacock&rsquo;s feathers is too much for him.&nbsp; I can imagine
him with a banjo&mdash;but a guitar decorated with pink
ribbons!&nbsp; To begin with he is not dressed for it.&nbsp;
Unless a family be prepared to make themselves up as troubadours
or cavaliers and to talk blank verse, I don&rsquo;t see how they
can expect to be happy living in these fifteenth-century
houses.&nbsp; The modern family&mdash;the old man in baggy
trousers and a frock-coat he could not button if he tried to; the
mother of figure distinctly Victorian; the boys in flannel suits
and collars up to their ears; the girls in motor caps&mdash;are
as incongruous in these medi&aelig;val dwellings as a party of
Cook&rsquo;s tourists drinking bottled beer in the streets of
Pompeii.</p>
<p>The designer of &ldquo;The Artistic Home&rdquo; is right in
keeping to still life.&nbsp; In the artistic home&mdash;to
paraphrase Dr. Watts&mdash;every prospect pleases and only man is
inartistic.&nbsp; In the picture, the artistic bedroom, &ldquo;in
apple green, the bedstead of cherry-wood, with a touch of
turkey-red throughout the draperies,&rdquo; is charming.&nbsp; It
need hardly be said the bed is empty.&nbsp; Put a man or woman in
that cherry-wood bed&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care how artistic they
may think themselves&mdash;the charm would be gone.&nbsp; The
really artistic party, one supposes, has a little room behind,
where he sleeps and dresses himself.&nbsp; He peeps in at the
door of this artistic bedroom, maybe occasionally enters to
change the roses.</p>
<p>Imagine the artistic nursery five minutes after the real child
had been let loose in it.&nbsp; I know a lady who once spent
hundreds of pounds on an artistic nursery.&nbsp; She showed it to
her friends with pride.&nbsp; The children were allowed in there
on Sunday afternoons.&nbsp; I did an equally silly thing myself
not long ago.&nbsp; Lured by a furniture catalogue, I started
Robina in a boudoir.&nbsp; I gave it to her as a
birthday-present.&nbsp; We have both regretted it ever
since.&nbsp; Robina reckons she could have had a bicycle, a
diamond bracelet, and a mandoline, and I should have saved
money.&nbsp; I did the thing well.&nbsp; I told the furniture
people I wanted it just as it stood in the picture: &ldquo;Design
for bedroom and boudoir combined, suitable for young girl, in
teak, with sparrow blue hangings.&rdquo;&nbsp; We had everything:
the antique fire arrangements that a vestal virgin might possibly
have understood; the candlesticks, that were pictures in
themselves, until we tried to put candles in them; the book-case
and writing-desk combined, that wasn&rsquo;t big enough to write
on, and out of which it was impossible to get a book until you
had abandoned the idea of writing and had closed the cover; the
enclosed washstand, that shut down and looked like an old bureau,
with the inevitable bowl of flowers upon it that had to be taken
off and put on the floor whenever you wanted to use the thing as
a washstand; the toilet-table, with its cunning little glass,
just big enough to see your nose in; the bedstead, hidden away
behind the &ldquo;thinking corner,&rdquo; where the girl
couldn&rsquo;t get at it to make it.&nbsp; A prettier room you
could not have imagined, till Robina started sleeping in
it.&nbsp; I think she tried.&nbsp; Girl friends of hers, to whom
she had bragged about it, would drop in and ask to be allowed to
see it.&nbsp; Robina would say, &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; and
would run up and slam the door; and we would hear her for the
next half-hour or so rushing round opening and shutting drawers
and dragging things about.&nbsp; By the time it was a boudoir
again she was exhausted and irritable.&nbsp; She wants now to
give it up to Veronica, but Veronica objects to the position,
which is between the bathroom and my study.&nbsp; Her idea is a
room more removed, where she would be able to shut herself in and
do her work, as she explains, without fear of interruption.</p>
<p>Young Bute told me that a friend of his, a well-to-do young
fellow, who lived in Piccadilly, had had the whim to make his
flat the reproduction of a Roman villa.&nbsp; There were of
course no fires, the rooms were warmed by hot air from the
kitchen.&nbsp; They had a cheerless aspect on a November
afternoon, and nobody knew exactly where to sit.&nbsp; Light was
obtained in the evening from Grecian lamps, which made it easy to
understand why the ancient Athenians, as a rule, went to bed
early.&nbsp; You dined sprawling on a couch.&nbsp; This was no
doubt practicable when you took your plate into your hand and fed
yourself with your fingers; but with a knife and fork the meal
had all the advantages of a hot picnic.&nbsp; You did not feel
luxurious or even wicked: you only felt nervous about your
clothes.&nbsp; The thing lacked completeness.&nbsp; He could not
expect his friends to come to him in Roman togas, and even his
own man declined firmly to wear the costume of a Roman
slave.&nbsp; The compromise was unsatisfactory, even from the
purely pictorial point of view.&nbsp; You cannot be a Roman
patrician of the time of Antoninus when you happen to live in
Piccadilly at the opening of the twentieth century.&nbsp; All you
can do is to make your friends uncomfortable and spoil their
dinner for them.&nbsp; Young Bute said that, so far as he was
concerned, he would always rather have spent the evening with his
little nephews and nieces, playing at horses; it seemed to him a
more sensible game.</p>
<p>Young Bute said that, speaking as an architect, he of course
admired the ancient masterpieces of his art.&nbsp; He admired the
Erechtheum at Athens; but Spurgeon&rsquo;s Tabernacle in the Old
Kent Road built upon the same model would have irritated
him.&nbsp; For a Grecian temple you wanted Grecian skies and
Grecian girls.&nbsp; He said that, even as it was, Westminster
Abbey in the season was an eyesore to him.&nbsp; The Dean and
Choir in their white surplices passed muster, but the
congregation in its black frock-coats and Paris hats gave him the
same sense of incongruity as would a banquet of barefooted friars
in the dining-hall of the Cannon Street Hotel.</p>
<p>It struck me there was sense in what he said.&nbsp; I decided
not to mention my idea of carving 1553 above the front-door.</p>
<p>He said he could not understand this passion of the modern
house-builder for playing at being a Crusader or a Canterbury
Pilgrim.&nbsp; A retired Berlin boot-maker of his acquaintance
had built himself a miniature Roman Castle near Heidelberg.&nbsp;
They played billiards in the dungeon, and let off fireworks on
the Kaiser&rsquo;s birthday from the roof of the watch-tower.</p>
<p>Another acquaintance of his, a draper at Holloway, had built
himself a moated grange.&nbsp; The moat was supplied from the
water-works under special arrangement, and all the electric
lights were imitation candles.&nbsp; He had done the thing
thoroughly.&nbsp; He had even designed a haunted chamber in blue,
and a miniature chapel, which he used as a telephone
closet.&nbsp; Young Bute had been invited down there for the
shooting in the autumn.&nbsp; He said he could not be sure
whether he was doing right or wrong, but his intention was to
provide himself with a bow and arrows.</p>
<p>A change was coming over this young man.&nbsp; We had talked
on other subjects and he had been shy and deferential.&nbsp; On
this matter of bricks and mortar he spoke as one explaining
things.</p>
<p>I ventured to say a few words in favour of the Tudor
house.&nbsp; The Tudor house, he argued, was a fit and proper
residence for the Tudor citizen&mdash;for the man whose wife rode
behind him on a pack-saddle, who conducted his correspondence by
the help of a moss-trooper.&nbsp; The Tudor fireplace was
designed for folks to whom coal was unknown, and who left their
smoking to their chimneys.&nbsp; A house that looked ridiculous
with a motor-car before the door, where the electric bell jarred
upon one&rsquo;s sense of fitness every time one heard it, was
out of date, he maintained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you, sir,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;a
twentieth-century writer, to build yourself a Tudor House would
be as absurd as for Ben Jonson to have planned himself a Norman
Castle with a torture-chamber underneath the wine-cellar, and the
fireplace in the middle of the dining-hall.&nbsp; His fellow
cronies of the Mermaid would have thought him stark, staring
mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was reason in what he was saying.&nbsp; I decided not to
mention my idea of altering the chimneys and fixing up imitation
gables, especially as young Bute seemed pleased with the house,
which by this time we had reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that is a good house,&rdquo; said young
Bute.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is a house where a man in a frock-coat
and trousers can sit down and not feel himself a stranger from
another age.&nbsp; It was built for a man who wore a frock-coat
and trousers&mdash;on weekdays, maybe, gaiters and a
shooting-coat.&nbsp; You can enjoy a game of billiards in that
house without the feeling that comes to you when playing tennis
in the shadow of the Pyramids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We entered, and I put before him my notions&mdash;such of them
as I felt he would approve.&nbsp; We were some time about the
business, and when we looked at our watches young Bute&rsquo;s
last train to town had gone.&nbsp; There still remained much to
talk about, and I suggested he should return with me to the
cottage and take his luck.&nbsp; I could sleep with Dick and he
could have my room.&nbsp; I told him about the cow, but he said
he was a practised sleeper and would be delighted, if I could
lend him a night-shirt, and if I thought Miss Robina would not be
put out.&nbsp; I assured him that it would be a good thing for
Robina; the unexpected guest would be a useful lesson to her in
housekeeping.&nbsp; Besides, as I pointed out to him, it
didn&rsquo;t really matter even if Robina were put out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to you, sir, perhaps,&rdquo; he answered, with a
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not with you that she will be
indignant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all right, my boy,&rdquo; I told him;
&ldquo;I take all responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall get all the blame,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>But, as I pointed out to him, it really didn&rsquo;t matter
whom Robina blamed.&nbsp; We talked about women generally on our
way back.&nbsp; I told him&mdash;impressing upon him there was no
need for it to go farther&mdash;that I personally had come to the
conclusion that the best way to deal with women was to treat them
all as children.&nbsp; He agreed it might be a good method, but
wanted to know what you did when they treated you as a child.</p>
<p>I know a most delightful couple: they have been married nearly
twenty years, and both will assure you that an angry word has
never passed between them.&nbsp; He calls her his &ldquo;Little
One,&rdquo; although she must be quite six inches taller than
himself, and is never tired of patting her hand or pinching her
ear.&nbsp; They asked her once in the drawing-room&mdash;so the
Little Mother tells me&mdash;her recipe for domestic bliss.&nbsp;
She said the mistake most women made was taking men too
seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are just overgrown children, that&rsquo;s all they
are, poor dears,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of love: there is the love that kneels and
looks upward, and the love that looks down and pats.&nbsp; For
durability I am prepared to back the latter.</p>
<p>The architect had died out of young Bute; he was again a shy
young man during our walk back to the cottage.&nbsp; My hand was
on the latch when he stayed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the back-door again, sir?&rdquo; he
enquired.</p>
<p>It was the back-door; I had not noticed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better go round to the front, sir,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>But he had disappeared.&nbsp; So I followed him, and we
entered by the front.&nbsp; Robina was standing by the table,
peeling potatoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have brought Mr. Bute back with me,&rdquo; I
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is going to stop the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina said: &ldquo;If ever I go to live in a cottage again it
will have one door.&rdquo;&nbsp; She took her potatoes with her
and went upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope she isn&rsquo;t put out,&rdquo; said young
Bute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself,&rdquo; I comforted
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course she isn&rsquo;t put out.&nbsp;
Besides, I don&rsquo;t care if she is.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got to
get used to being put out; it&rsquo;s part of the lesson of
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took him upstairs, meaning to show him his bedroom and take
my own things out of it.&nbsp; The doors of the two bedrooms were
opposite one another.&nbsp; I made a mistake and opened the wrong
door.&nbsp; Robina, still peeling potatoes, was sitting on the
bed.</p>
<p>I explained we had made a mistake.&nbsp; Robina said it was of
no consequence whatever, and, taking the potatoes with her, went
downstairs again.&nbsp; Looking out of the window, I saw her
making towards the wood.&nbsp; She was taking the potatoes with
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish we hadn&rsquo;t opened the door of the wrong
room,&rdquo; groaned young Bute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a worrying chap you are!&rdquo; I said to
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at the thing from the humorous point of
view.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s funny when you come to think of it.&nbsp;
Wherever the poor girl goes, trying to peel her potatoes in peace
and quietness, we burst in upon her.&nbsp; What we ought to do
now is to take a walk in the wood.&nbsp; It is a pretty
wood.&nbsp; We might say we had come to pick wild
flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I could not persuade him.&nbsp; He said he had letters to
write, and, if I would allow him, would remain in his room till
dinner was ready.</p>
<p>Dick and Veronica came in a little later.&nbsp; Dick had been
to see Mr. St. Leonard to arrange about lessons in farming.&nbsp;
He said he thought I should like the old man, who wasn&rsquo;t a
bit like a farmer.&nbsp; He had brought Veronica back in one of
her good moods, she having met there and fallen in love with a
donkey.&nbsp; Dick confided to me that, without committing
himself, he had hinted to Veronica that if she would remain good
for quite a long while I might be induced to buy it for
her.&nbsp; It was a sturdy little animal, and could be made
useful.&nbsp; Anyhow, it would give Veronica an object in
life&mdash;something to strive for&mdash;which was just what she
wanted.&nbsp; He is a thoughtful lad at times, is Dick.</p>
<p>The dinner was more successful than I had hoped for.&nbsp;
Robina gave us melon as a <i>hors d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>,
followed by sardines and a fowl, with potatoes and vegetable
marrow.&nbsp; Her cooking surprised me.&nbsp; I had warned young
Bute that it might be necessary to regard this dinner rather as a
joke than as an evening meal, and was prepared myself to extract
amusement from it rather than nourishment.&nbsp; My
disappointment was agreeable.&nbsp; One can always imagine a
comic dinner.</p>
<p>I dined once with a newly married couple who had just returned
from their honeymoon.&nbsp; We ought to have sat down at eight
o&rsquo;clock; we sat down instead at half-past ten.&nbsp; The
cook had started drinking in the morning; by seven o&rsquo;clock
she was speechless.&nbsp; The wife, giving up hope at a quarter
to eight, had cooked the dinner herself.&nbsp; The other guests
were sympathised with, but all I got was congratulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll write something so funny about this
dinner,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>You might have thought the cook had got drunk on purpose to
oblige me.&nbsp; I have never been able to write anything funny
about that dinner; it depresses me to this day, merely thinking
of it.</p>
<p>We finished up with a cold trifle and some excellent coffee
that Robina brewed over a lamp on the table while Dick and
Veronica cleared away.&nbsp; It was one of the jolliest little
dinners I have ever eaten; and, if Robina&rsquo;s figures are to
be trusted, cost exactly six-and-fourpence for the five of
us.&nbsp; There being no servants about, we talked freely and
enjoyed ourselves.&nbsp; I began once at a dinner to tell a good
story about a Scotchman, when my host silenced me with a
look.&nbsp; He is a kindly man, and had heard the story
before.&nbsp; He explained to me afterwards, over the walnuts,
that his parlourmaid was Scotch and rather touchy.&nbsp; The talk
fell into the discussion of Home Rule, and again our host
silenced us.&nbsp; It seemed his butler was an Irishman and a
violent Parnellite.&nbsp; Some people can talk as though servants
were mere machines, but to me they are human beings, and their
presence hampers me.&nbsp; I know my guests have not heard the
story before, and from one&rsquo;s own flesh and blood one
expects a certain amount of sacrifice.&nbsp; But I feel so sorry
for the housemaid who is waiting; she must have heard it a dozen
times.&nbsp; I really cannot inflict it upon her again.</p>
<p>After dinner we pushed the table into a corner, and Dick
extracted a sort of waltz from Robina&rsquo;s mandoline.&nbsp; It
is years since I danced; but Veronica said she would rather dance
with me any day than with some of the &ldquo;lumps&rdquo; you
were given to drag round by the dancing-mistress.&nbsp; I have
half a mind to take it up again.&nbsp; After all, a man is only
as old as he feels.</p>
<p>Young Bute, it turned out, was a capital dancer, and could
even reverse, which in a room fourteen feet square is of
advantage.&nbsp; Robina confided to me after he was gone that
while he was dancing she could just tolerate him.&nbsp; I cannot
myself see rhyme or reason in Robina&rsquo;s objection to
him.&nbsp; He is not handsome, but he is good-looking, as boys
go, and has a pleasant smile.&nbsp; Robina says it is his smile
that maddens her.&nbsp; Dick agrees with me that there is sense
in him; and Veronica, not given to loose praise, considers his
performance of a Red Indian, both dead and alive, the finest
piece of acting she has ever encountered.&nbsp; We wound up the
evening with a little singing.&nbsp; The extent of Dick&rsquo;s
repertoire surprised me; evidently he has not been so idle at
Cambridge as it seemed.&nbsp; Young Bute has a baritone voice of
some richness.&nbsp; We remembered at quarter-past eleven that
Veronica ought to have gone to bed at eight.&nbsp; We were all of
us surprised at the lateness of the hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we always live in a cottage and do just
as we like?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s much jollier,&rdquo;
Veronica put it to me as I kissed her good night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we are idiots, most of us, Veronica,&rdquo; I
answered.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">started</span> the next morning to call
upon St. Leonard.&nbsp; Near to the house I encountered young
Hopkins on a horse.&nbsp; He was waving a pitchfork over his head
and reciting &ldquo;The Charge of the Light Brigade.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The horse looked amused.&nbsp; He told me I should find
&ldquo;the gov&rsquo;nor&rdquo; up by the stables.&nbsp; St.
Leonard is not an &ldquo;old man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dick must have
seen him in a bad light.&nbsp; I should describe him as about the
prime of life, a little older than myself, but nothing to speak
of.&nbsp; Dick was right, however, in saying he was not like a
farmer.&nbsp; To begin with, &ldquo;Hubert St. Leonard&rdquo;
does not sound like a farmer.&nbsp; One can imagine a man with a
name like that writing a book about farming, having theories on
this subject.&nbsp; But in the ordinary course of nature things
would not grow for him.&nbsp; He does not look like a
farmer.&nbsp; One cannot say precisely what it is, but there is
that about a farmer that tells you he is a farmer.&nbsp; The
farmer has a way of leaning over a gate.&nbsp; There are not many
ways of leaning over a gate.&nbsp; I have tried all I could think
of, but it was never quite the right way.&nbsp; It has to be in
the blood.&nbsp; A farmer has a way of standing on one leg and
looking at a thing that isn&rsquo;t there.&nbsp; It sounds
simple, but there is knack in it.&nbsp; The farmer is not
surprised it is not there.&nbsp; He never expected it to be
there.&nbsp; It is one of those things that ought to be, and is
not.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s life is full of such.&nbsp;
Suffering reduced to a science is what the farmer stands
for.&nbsp; All his life he is the good man struggling against
adversity.&nbsp; Nothing his way comes right.&nbsp; This does not
seem to be his planet.&nbsp; Providence means well, but she does
not understand farming.&nbsp; She is doing her best, he supposes;
that she is a born muddler is not her fault.&nbsp; If Providence
could only step down for a month or two and take a few lessons in
practical farming, things might be better; but this being out of
the question there is nothing more to be said.&nbsp; From
conversation with farmers one conjures up a picture of Providence
as a well-intentioned amateur, put into a position for which she
is utterly unsuited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rain,&rdquo; says Providence, &ldquo;they are wanting
rain.&nbsp; What did I do with that rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She finds the rain and starts it, and is pleased with herself
until some Wandering Spirit pauses on his way and asks her
sarcastically what she thinks she&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raining,&rdquo; explains Providence.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
wanted rain&mdash;farmers, you know, that sort of
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t want anything for long,&rdquo; retorts
the Spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be drowned in their beds
before you&rsquo;ve done with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; says Providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have a look for yourself if you won&rsquo;t
believe me,&rdquo; says the Spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
spoilt that harvest again, you&rsquo;ve ruined all the fruit, and
you are rotting even the turnips.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you ever
learn by experience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so difficult,&rdquo; says Providence, &ldquo;to
regulate these things just right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it seems&mdash;for you,&rdquo; retorts the
Spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyhow, I should not rain any more, if I
were you.&nbsp; If you must, at least give them time to build
another ark.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Wandering Spirit continues on
his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place does look a bit wet, now I come to notice
it,&rdquo; says Providence, peeping down over the edge of her
star.&nbsp; &ldquo;Better turn on the fine weather, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She starts with she calls &ldquo;set fair,&rdquo; and feeling
now that she is something like a Providence, composes herself for
a doze.&nbsp; She is startled out of her sleep by the return of
the Wandering Spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been down there again?&rdquo; she asks him
pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just come back,&rdquo; explains the Wandering
Spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty spot, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; says
Providence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Things nice and dry down there now,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it,&rdquo; he answers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dry is the word.&nbsp; The rivers are dried up, the wells
are dried up, the cattle are dying, the grass is all
withered.&nbsp; As for the harvest, there won&rsquo;t be any
harvest for the next two years!&nbsp; Oh, yes, things are dry
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One imagines Providence bursting into tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
you suggested yourself a little fine weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I did,&rdquo; answers the Spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t suggest a six months&rsquo; drought with the
thermometer at a hundred and twenty in the shade.&nbsp;
Doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that you&rsquo;ve got any sense at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish this job had been given to someone
else,&rdquo; says Providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you are not the only one to wish it,&rdquo;
retorts the Spirit unfeelingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do my best,&rdquo; urges Providence, wiping her eyes
with her wings.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not fitted for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A truer word you never uttered,&rdquo; retorts the
Spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try&mdash;nobody could try harder,&rdquo; wails
Providence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything I do seems to be
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want,&rdquo; says the Spirit, &ldquo;is less
enthusiasm and a little commonsense in place of it.&nbsp; You get
excited, and then you lose your head.&nbsp; When you do send
rain, ten to one you send it when it isn&rsquo;t wanted.&nbsp;
You keep back your sunshine&mdash;just as a duffer at whist keeps
back his trumps&mdash;until it is no good, and then you deal it
out all at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try again,&rdquo; said Providence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try quite hard this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been trying again,&rdquo; retorts the
Spirit unsympathetically, &ldquo;ever since I have known
you.&nbsp; It is not that you do not try.&nbsp; It is that you
have not got the hang of things.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you get
yourself an almanack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wandering Spirit takes his leave.&nbsp; Providence tells
herself she really must get that almanack.&nbsp; She ties a knot
in her handkerchief.&nbsp; It is not her fault: she was made like
it.&nbsp; She forgets altogether for what reason she tied that
knot.&nbsp; Thinks it was to remind her to send frosts in May, or
Scotch mists in August.&nbsp; She is not sure which, so sends
both.&nbsp; The farmer has ceased even to be angry with
her&mdash;recognises that affliction and sorrow are good for his
immortal soul, and pursues his way in calmness to the Bankruptcy
Court.</p>
<p>Hubert St. Leonard, of Windrush Bottom Farm, I found to be a
worried-looking gentleman.&nbsp; He taps his weather-glass, and
hopes and fears, not knowing as yet that all things have been
ordered for his ill.&nbsp; It will be years before his spirit is
attuned to that attitude of tranquil despair essential to the
farmer: one feels it.&nbsp; He is tall and thin, with a
sensitive, mobile face, and a curious trick of taking his head
every now and again between his hands, as if to be sure it is
still there.&nbsp; When I met him he was on the point of starting
for his round, so I walked with him.&nbsp; He told me that he had
not always been a farmer.&nbsp; Till a few years ago he had been
a stockbroker.&nbsp; But he had always hated his office; and
having saved a little, had determined when he came to forty to
enjoy the rare luxury of living his own life.&nbsp; I asked him
if he found that farming paid.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As in everything else, it depends upon the price you
put upon yourself.&nbsp; Now, as a casual observer, what wage per
annum would you say I was worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an awkward question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are afraid that if you spoke candidly you would
offend me,&rdquo; he suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; For
the purpose of explaining my theory let us take, instead, your
own case.&nbsp; I have read all your books, and I like
them.&nbsp; Speaking as an admirer, I should estimate you at five
hundred a year.&nbsp; You, perhaps, make two thousand, and
consider yourself worth five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whimsical smile with which he accompanied the speech
disarmed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we most of us do,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is
to over-capitalise ourselves.&nbsp; John Smith, honestly worth a
hundred a year, claims to be worth two.&nbsp; Result: difficulty
of earning dividend, over-work, over-worry, constant fear of
being wound up.&nbsp; Now, there is that about your work that
suggests to me you would be happier earning five hundred a year
than you ever will be earning two thousand.&nbsp; To pay your
dividend&mdash;to earn your two thousand&mdash;you have to do
work that brings you no pleasure in the doing.&nbsp; Content with
five hundred, you could afford to do only that work that does
give you pleasure.&nbsp; This is not a perfect world, we must
remember.&nbsp; In the perfect world the thinker would be worth
more than the mere jester.&nbsp; In the perfect world the farmer
would be worth more than the stockbroker.&nbsp; In making the
exchange I had to write myself down.&nbsp; I earn less money, but
get more enjoyment out of life.&nbsp; I used to be able to afford
champagne, but my liver was always wrong, and I dared not drink
it.&nbsp; Now I cannot afford champagne, but I enjoy my
beer.&nbsp; That is my theory, that we are all of us entitled to
payment according to our market value, neither more nor
less.&nbsp; You can take it all in cash.&nbsp; I used to.&nbsp;
Or you can take less cash and more fun: that is what I am getting
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is delightful,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to meet with a
philosopher.&nbsp; One hears about them, of course; but I had got
it into my mind they were all dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People laugh at philosophy,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never could understand why.&nbsp; It is the science of
living a free, peaceful, happy existence.&nbsp; I would give half
my remaining years to be a philosopher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not laughing at philosophy,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I honestly thought you were a philosopher.&nbsp; I judged
so from the way you talked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talked!&rdquo; he retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anybody can
talk.&nbsp; As you have just said, I talk like a
philosopher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you not only talk,&rdquo; I insisted, &ldquo;you
behave like a philosopher.&nbsp; Sacrificing your income to the
joy of living your own life!&nbsp; It is the act of a
philosopher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wanted to keep him in good humour.&nbsp; I had three things
to talk to him about: the cow, the donkey, and Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
philosopher would have remained a stockbroker and been just as
happy.&nbsp; Philosophy does not depend upon environment.&nbsp;
You put the philosopher down anywhere.&nbsp; It is all the same
to him, he takes his philosophy with him.&nbsp; You can suddenly
tell him he is an emperor, or give him penal servitude for
life.&nbsp; He goes on being a philosopher just as if nothing had
happened.&nbsp; We have an old tom-cat.&nbsp; The children lead
it an awful life.&nbsp; It does not seem to matter to the
cat.&nbsp; They shut it up in the piano: their idea is that it
will make a noise and frighten someone.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t
make a noise; it goes to sleep.&nbsp; When an hour later someone
opens the piano, the poor thing is lying there stretched out upon
the keyboard purring to itself.&nbsp; They dress it up in the
baby&rsquo;s clothes and take it out in the perambulator: it lies
there perfectly contented looking round at the
scenery&mdash;takes in the fresh air.&nbsp; They haul it about by
its tail.&nbsp; You would think, to watch it swinging gently to
and fro head downwards, that it was grateful to them for giving
it a new sensation.&nbsp; Apparently it looks on everything that
comes its way as helpful experience.&nbsp; It lost a leg last
winter in a trap: it goes about quite cheerfully on three.&nbsp;
Seems to be rather pleased, if anything, at having lost the
fourth&mdash;saves washing.&nbsp; Now, he is your true
philosopher, that cat; never minds what happens to him, and is
equally contented if it doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found myself becoming fretful.&nbsp; I know a man with whom
it is impossible to disagree.&nbsp; Men at the
Club&mdash;new-comers&mdash;have been lured into taking bets that
they could on any topic under the sun find themselves out of
sympathy with him.&nbsp; They have denounced Mr. Lloyd George as
a traitor to his country.&nbsp; This man has risen and shaken
them by the hand, words being too weak to express his admiration
of their outspoken fearlessness.&nbsp; You might have thought
them Nihilists denouncing the Russian Government from the steps
of the Kremlin at Moscow.&nbsp; They have, in the next breath,
abused Mr. Balfour in terms transgressing the law of
slander.&nbsp; He has almost fallen on their necks.&nbsp; It has
transpired that the one dream of his life was to hear Mr. Balfour
abused.&nbsp; I have talked to him myself for a quarter of an
hour, and gathered that at heart he was a peace-at-any-price man,
strongly in favour of Conscription, a vehement Republican, with a
deep-rooted contempt for the working classes.&nbsp; It is not bad
sport to collect half a dozen and talk round him.&nbsp; At such
times he suggests the family dog that six people from different
parts of the house are calling to at the same time.&nbsp; He
wants to go to them all at once.</p>
<p>I felt I had got to understand this man, or he would worry
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to be neighbours,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and I am inclined to think I shall like you.&nbsp; That
is, if I can get to know you.&nbsp; You commence by enthusing on
philosophy: I hasten to agree with you.&nbsp; It is a noble
science.&nbsp; When my youngest daughter has grown up, when the
other one has learnt a little sense, when Dick is off my hands,
and the British public has come to appreciate good literature, I
am hoping to be a bit of a philosopher myself.&nbsp; But before I
can explain to you my views you have already changed your own,
and are likening the philosopher to an old tom-cat that seems to
be weak in his head.&nbsp; Soberly now, what are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fool,&rdquo; he answered promptly; &ldquo;a most
unfortunate fool.&nbsp; I have the mind of a philosopher coupled
to an intensely irritable temperament.&nbsp; My philosophy
teaches me to be ashamed of my irritability, and my irritability
makes my philosophy appear to be arrant nonsense to myself.&nbsp;
The philosopher in me tells me it does not matter when the twins
fall down the wishing-well.&nbsp; It is not a deep well.&nbsp; It
is not the first time they have fallen into it: it will not be
the last.&nbsp; Such things pass: the philosopher only
smiles.&nbsp; The man in me calls the philosopher a blithering
idiot for saying it does not matter when it does matter.&nbsp;
Men have to be called away from their work to haul them
out.&nbsp; We all of us get wet.&nbsp; I get wet and excited, and
that always starts my liver.&nbsp; The children&rsquo;s clothes
are utterly spoilt.&nbsp; Confound them,&rdquo;&mdash;the blood
was mounting to his head&mdash;&ldquo;they never care to go near
the well except they are dressed in their best clothes.&nbsp; On
other days they will stop indoors and read Foxe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Book of Martyrs.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is something uncanny
about twins.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Why should twins be worse
than other children?&nbsp; The ordinary child is not an angel,
Heaven knows.&nbsp; Take these boots of mine.&nbsp; Look at them;
I have had them for over two years.&nbsp; I tramp ten miles a day
in them; they have been soaked through a hundred times.&nbsp; You
buy a boy a pair of boots&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you cover over the well?&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are again,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The philosopher in me&mdash;the sensible man&mdash;says,
&lsquo;What is the good of the well?&nbsp; It is nothing but mud
and rubbish.&nbsp; Something is always falling into it&mdash;if
it isn&rsquo;t the children it&rsquo;s the pigs.&nbsp; Why not do
away with it?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be sound advice,&rdquo; I commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;No man alive has
more sound commonsense than I have, if only I were capable of
listening to myself.&nbsp; Do you know why I don&rsquo;t brick in
that well?&nbsp; Because my wife told me I would have to.&nbsp;
It was the first thing she said when she saw it.&nbsp; She says
it again every time anything does fall into it.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
only you would take my advice&rsquo;&mdash;you know the sort of
thing.&nbsp; Nobody irritates me more than the person who says,
&lsquo;I told you so.&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a picturesque old
ruin: it used to be haunted.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all been knocked
on the head since we came.&nbsp; What self-respecting nymph can
haunt a well into which children and pigs are for ever
flopping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed; but before I could join him he was angry
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I block up an historic well, that
is an ornament to the garden, because a pack of fools can&rsquo;t
keep a gate shut?&nbsp; As for the children, what they want is a
thorough good whipping, and one of these days&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice crying to us to stop interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am on my round.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he
shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must,&rdquo; explained the voice.</p>
<p>He turned so quickly that he almost knocked me over.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bother and confound them all!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they keep to the time-table?&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no system in this place.&nbsp; That is what ruins
farming&mdash;want of system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on grumbling as he walked.&nbsp; I followed him.&nbsp;
Halfway across the field we met the owner of the voice.&nbsp; She
was a pleasant-looking lass, not exactly pretty&mdash;not the
sort of girl one turns to look at in a crowd&mdash;yet, having
seen her, it was agreeable to continue looking at her.&nbsp; St.
Leonard introduced me to her as his eldest daughter, Janie, and
explained to her that behind the study door, if only she would
take the trouble to look, she would find a time-table&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to which,&rdquo; replied Miss Janie, with a
smile, &ldquo;you ought at the present moment to be in the
rick-yard, which is just where I want you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; he asked, feeling his waistcoat
for a watch that appeared not to be there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarter to eleven,&rdquo; I told him.</p>
<p>He took his head between his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new binder, Miss Janie told us, had just arrived.&nbsp;
She was anxious her father should see it was in working order
before the men went back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Otherwise,&rdquo; so she
argued, &ldquo;old Wilkins will persist it was all right when he
delivered it, and we shall have no remedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We turned towards the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of the practical,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there
were three things I came to talk to you about.&nbsp; First and
foremost, that cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, the cow,&rdquo; said St. Leonard.&nbsp; He
turned to his daughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was Maud, was it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;it was
Susie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the one,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that bellows most
all night and three parts of the day.&nbsp; Your boy Hopkins
thinks maybe she&rsquo;s fretting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor soul!&rdquo; said St. Leonard.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
only took her calf away from her&mdash;when did we take her calf
away from her?&rdquo; he asked of Janie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Thursday morning,&rdquo; returned Janie; &ldquo;the
day we sent her over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They feel it so at first,&rdquo; said St. Leonard
sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds a brutal sentiment,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but
I was wondering if by any chance you happened to have by you one
that didn&rsquo;t feel it quite so much.&nbsp; I suppose among
cows there is no class that corresponds to what we term our
&lsquo;Smart Set&rsquo;&mdash;cows that don&rsquo;t really care
for their calves, that are glad to get away from them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Janie smiled.&nbsp; When she smiled, you felt you would
do much to see her smile again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not keep it up at your house, in the
paddock,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;and have the milk brought
down?&nbsp; There is an excellent cowshed, and it is only a mile
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck me there was sense in this idea.&nbsp; I had not
thought of that.&nbsp; I asked St. Leonard what I owed him for
the cow.&nbsp; He asked Miss Janie, and she said sixteen
pounds.&nbsp; I had been warned that in doing business with
farmers it would be necessary always to bargain; but there was
that about Miss Janie&rsquo;s tone telling me that when she said
sixteen pounds she meant sixteen pounds.&nbsp; I began to see a
brighter side to Hubert St. Leonard&rsquo;s career as a
farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;we will regard the cow
as settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made a note: &ldquo;Cow, sixteen pounds.&nbsp; Have the
cowshed got ready, and buy one of those big cans on
wheels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to want milk?&rdquo; I put it to
Miss Janie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Susie seems to be good for about five
gallons a day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid if we drink it all
ourselves we&rsquo;ll get too fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At twopence halfpenny a quart, delivered at the house,
as much as you like,&rdquo; replied Miss Janie.</p>
<p>I made a note of that also.&nbsp; &ldquo;Happen to know a
useful boy?&rdquo; I asked Miss Janie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about young Hopkins,&rdquo; suggested her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only male thing on this farm&mdash;with the
exception of yourself, of course, father dear&mdash;that has got
any sense,&rdquo; said Miss Janie.&nbsp; &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t
have Hopkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only fault I have to find with Hopkins,&rdquo; said
St. Leonard, &ldquo;is that he talks too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I should prefer a
country lad.&nbsp; I have come down here to be in the
country.&nbsp; With Hopkins around, I don&rsquo;t somehow feel it
is the country.&nbsp; I might imagine it a garden city: that is
as near as Hopkins would allow me to get.&nbsp; I should like
myself something more suggestive of rural simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know the sort of thing you mean,&rdquo;
smiled Miss Janie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you fairly
good-tempered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can generally,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;confine
myself to sarcasm.&nbsp; It pleases me, and as far as I have been
able to notice, does neither harm nor good to anyone
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you up a boy,&rdquo; promised Miss
Janie.</p>
<p>I thanked her.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now we come to the
donkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nathaniel,&rdquo; explained Miss Janie, in answer to
her father&rsquo;s look of enquiry.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
really want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janie,&rdquo; said Mr. St. Leonard in a tone of
authority, &ldquo;I insist upon being honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to be honest,&rdquo; retorted Miss Janie,
offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter Veronica has given me to understand,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;that if I buy her this donkey it will be, for her,
the commencement of a new and better life.&nbsp; I do not attach
undue importance to the bargain, but one never knows.&nbsp; The
influences that make for reformation in human character are
subtle and unexpected.&nbsp; Anyhow, it doesn&rsquo;t seem right
to throw a chance away.&nbsp; Added to which, it has occurred to
me that a donkey might be useful in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has lived at my expense for upwards of two
years,&rdquo; replied St. Leonard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot myself
see any moral improvement he has brought into my family.&nbsp;
What effect he may have upon your children, I cannot say.&nbsp;
But when you talk about his being useful in a
garden&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He draws a cart,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Janie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as someone walks beside him feeding him with
carrots.&nbsp; We tried fixing the carrot on a pole six inches
beyond his reach.&nbsp; That works all right in the picture: it
starts this donkey kicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know yourself,&rdquo; he continued with growing
indignation, &ldquo;the very last time your mother took him out
she used up all her carrots getting there, with the result that
he and the cart had to be hauled home behind a
trolley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had reached the yard.&nbsp; Nathaniel was standing with his
head stretched out above the closed half of his stable
door.&nbsp; I noticed points of resemblance between him and
Veronica herself: there was about him a like suggestion of
resignation, of suffering virtue misunderstood; his eye had the
same wistful, yearning expression with which Veronica will stand
before the window gazing out upon the purple sunset, while people
are calling to her from distant parts of the house to come and
put her things away.&nbsp; Miss Janie, bending over him, asked
him to kiss her.&nbsp; He complied, but with a gentle,
reproachful look that seemed to say, &ldquo;Why call me back
again to earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It made me mad with him.&nbsp; I was wrong in thinking Miss
Janie not a pretty girl.&nbsp; Hers is that type of beauty that
escapes attention by its own perfection.&nbsp; It is the
eccentric, the discordant, that arrests the roving eye.&nbsp; To
harmony one has to attune oneself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Miss Janie, as she drew away,
wiping her cheek, &ldquo;one could teach that donkey
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently she regarded willingness to kiss her as indication
of exceptional amiability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except to work,&rdquo; commented her father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you take that donkey off my hands and
promise not to send it back again, why, you can have
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For nothing?&rdquo; demanded Janie woefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For nothing,&rdquo; insisted her father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And if I have any argument, I&rsquo;ll throw in the
cart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Janie sighed and shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; It was
arranged that Hopkins should deliver Nathaniel into my keeping
some time the next day.&nbsp; Hopkins, it appeared, was the only
person on the farm who could make the donkey go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; said St. Leonard,
&ldquo;but he has a way with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there remains but
Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lad I saw yesterday?&rdquo; suggested St.
Leonard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-looking young fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a nice boy,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t really think I know a nicer boy than Dick; and
clever, when you come to understand him.&nbsp; There is only one
fault I have to find with Dick: I don&rsquo;t seem able to get
him to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Janie was smiling.&nbsp; I asked her why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;how close
the resemblance appears to be between him and
Nathaniel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true.&nbsp; I had not thought of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mistake,&rdquo; said St. Leonard, &ldquo;is with
ourselves.&nbsp; We assume every boy to have the soul of a
professor, and every girl a genius for music.&nbsp; We pack off
our sons to cram themselves with Greek and Latin, and put our
daughters down to strum at the piano.&nbsp; Nine times out of ten
it is sheer waste of time.&nbsp; They sent me to Cambridge, and
said I was lazy.&nbsp; I was not lazy.&nbsp; I was not intended
by nature for a Senior Wrangler.&nbsp; I did not see the good of
being a Senior Wrangler.&nbsp; Who wants a world of Senior
Wranglers?&nbsp; Then why start every young man trying?&nbsp; I
wanted to be a farmer.&nbsp; If intelligent lads were taught
farming as a business, farming would pay.&nbsp; In the name of
commonsense&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am inclined to agree with you,&rdquo; I interrupted
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would rather see Dick a good farmer than a
third-rate barrister, anyhow.&nbsp; He thinks he could take an
interest in farming.&nbsp; There are ten weeks before he need go
back to Cambridge, sufficient time for the experiment.&nbsp; Will
you take him as a pupil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Leonard grasped his head between his hands and held it
firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I consent,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must
insist on being honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw the woefulness again in Janie&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is my turn to be
honest.&nbsp; I have got the donkey for nothing; I insist on
paying for Dick.&nbsp; They are waiting for you in the
rick-yard.&nbsp; I will settle the terms with Miss
Janie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He regarded us both suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will promise to be honest,&rdquo; laughed Miss
Janie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s more than I&rsquo;m worth,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send him home again.&nbsp; My theory
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stumbled over a pig which, according to the time-table,
ought not to have been there.&nbsp; They went off hurriedly
together, the pig leading, both screaming.</p>
<p>Miss Janie said she would show me the short cut across the
fields; we could talk as we went.&nbsp; We walked in silence for
awhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I like
being the one to do all the haggling.&nbsp; I feel a little sore
about it very often.&nbsp; But somebody, of course, must do it;
and as for father, poor dear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at her.&nbsp; Her&rsquo;s is the beauty to which a
touch of sadness adds a charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; I asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;next
birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judged you to be older,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people do,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter Robina,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is just the
same age&mdash;according to years; and Dick is twenty-one.&nbsp;
I hope you will be friends with them.&nbsp; They have got sense,
both of them.&nbsp; It comes out every now and again and
surprises you.&nbsp; Veronica, I think, is nine.&nbsp; I am not
sure how Veronica is going to turn out.&nbsp; Sometimes things
happen that make us think she has a beautiful character, and then
for quite long periods she seems to lose it altogether.&nbsp; The
Little Mother&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why we always call her
Little Mother&mdash;will not join us till things are more
ship-shape.&nbsp; She does not like to be thought an invalid, and
if we have her about anywhere near work that has to be done, and
are not always watching her, she gets at it and tires
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad we are going to be neighbours,&rdquo; said
Miss Janie.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are ten of us altogether.&nbsp;
Father, I am sure, you will like; clever men always like
father.&nbsp; Mother&rsquo;s day is Friday.&nbsp; As a rule it is
the only day no one ever calls.&rdquo;&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp;
The cloud had vanished.&nbsp; &ldquo;They come on other days and
find us all in our old clothes.&nbsp; On Friday afternoon we sit
in state and nobody comes near us, and we have to eat the cakes
ourselves.&nbsp; It makes her so cross.&nbsp; You will try and
remember Fridays, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made a note of it then and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the eldest,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;as I
think father told you.&nbsp; Harry and Jack came next; but Jack
is in Canada and Harry died, so there is somewhat of a gap
between me and the rest.&nbsp; Bertie is twelve and Ted eleven;
they are home just now for the holidays.&nbsp; Sally is eight,
and then there come the twins.&nbsp; People don&rsquo;t half
believe the tales that are told about twins, but I am sure there
is no need to exaggerate.&nbsp; They are only six, but they have
a sense of humour you would hardly credit.&nbsp; One is a boy,
and the other a girl.&nbsp; They are always changing clothes, and
we are never quite sure which is which.&nbsp; Wilfrid gets sent
to bed because Winnie has not practised her scales, and Winnie is
given syrup of squills because Wilfried has been eating green
gooseberries.&nbsp; Last spring Winnie had the measles.&nbsp;
When the doctor came on the fifth day he was as pleased as punch;
he said it was the quickest cure he had ever known, and that
really there was no reason why she might not get up.&nbsp; We had
our suspicions, and they were right.&nbsp; Winnie was hiding in
the cupboard, wrapped up in a blanket.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t
seem to mind what trouble they get into, provided it isn&rsquo;t
their own.&nbsp; The only safe plan, unless you happen to catch
them red-handed, is to divide the punishment between them, and
leave them to settle accounts between themselves
afterwards.&nbsp; Algy is four; till last year he was always
called the baby.&nbsp; Now, of course, there is no excuse; but
the name still clings to him in spite of his indignant
protestations.&nbsp; Father called upstairs to him the other day:
&lsquo;Baby, bring me down my gaiters.&rsquo;&nbsp; He walked
straight up to the cradle and woke up the baby.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get
up,&rsquo; I heard him say&mdash;I was just outside the
door&mdash;&lsquo;and take your father down his gaiters.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you hear him calling you?&rsquo;&nbsp; He is a droll
little fellow.&nbsp; Father took him to Oxford last
Saturday.&nbsp; He is small for his age.&nbsp; The
ticket-collector, quite contented, threw him a glance, and merely
as a matter of form asked if he was under three.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he shouted before father could reply; &lsquo;I
&rsquo;sists on being honest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;se four.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It is father&rsquo;s pet phrase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What view do you take of the exchange,&rdquo; I asked
her, &ldquo;from stockbroking with its larger income to farming
with its smaller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was selfish,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but
I am afraid I rather encouraged father.&nbsp; It seems to me
mean, making your living out of work that does no good to
anyone.&nbsp; I hate the bargaining, but the farming itself I
love.&nbsp; Of course, it means having only one evening dress a
year and making that myself.&nbsp; But even when I had a lot I
always preferred wearing the one that I thought suited me the
best.&nbsp; As for the children, they are as healthy as young
savages, and everything they want to make them happy is just
outside the door.&nbsp; The boys won&rsquo;t go to college; but
seeing they will have to earn their own living, that, perhaps, is
just as well.&nbsp; It is mother, poor dear, that worries
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; She laughed again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her favourite
walk is to the workhouse.&nbsp; She came back quite excited the
other day because she had heard the Guardians intend to try the
experiment of building separate houses for old married
couples.&nbsp; She is convinced she and father are going to end
their days there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, as the business partner,&rdquo; I asked her,
&ldquo;are hopeful that the farm will pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;it will pay all
right&mdash;it does pay, for the matter of that.&nbsp; We live on
it and live comfortably.&nbsp; But, of course, I can see
mother&rsquo;s point of view, with seven young children to bring
up.&nbsp; And it is not only that.&rdquo;&nbsp; She stopped
herself abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she continued
with a laugh, &ldquo;you have got to know us.&nbsp; Father is
trying.&nbsp; He loves experiments, and a woman hates
experiments.&nbsp; Last year it was bare feet.&nbsp; I daresay it
is healthier.&nbsp; But children who have been about in bare feet
all the morning&mdash;well, it isn&rsquo;t pleasant when they sit
down to lunch; I don&rsquo;t care what you say.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t be always washing.&nbsp; He is so unpractical.&nbsp;
He was quite angry with mother and myself because we
wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And a man in bare feet looks so
ridiculous.&nbsp; This summer it is short hair and no hats; and
Sally had such pretty hair.&nbsp; Next year it will be sabots or
turbans&mdash;something or other suggesting the idea that
we&rsquo;ve lately escaped from a fair.&nbsp; On Mondays and
Thursdays we talk French.&nbsp; We have got a French nurse; and
those are the only days in the week on which she doesn&rsquo;t
understand a word that&rsquo;s said to her.&nbsp; We can none of
us understand father, and that makes him furious.&nbsp; He
won&rsquo;t say it in English; he makes a note of it, meaning to
tell us on Tuesday or Friday, and then, of course, he forgets,
and wonders why we haven&rsquo;t done it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the
dearest fellow alive.&nbsp; When I think of him as a big boy,
then he is charming, and if he really were only a big boy there
are times when I would shake him and feel better for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed again.&nbsp; I wanted her to go on talking,
because her laugh was so delightful.&nbsp; But we had reached the
road, and she said she must go back: there were so many things
she had to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not settled about Dick,&rdquo; I reminded
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother took rather a liking to him,&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Dick could make a living,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;by
getting people to like him, I should not be so anxious about his
future&mdash;lazy young devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has promised to work hard if you let him take up
farming,&rdquo; said Miss Janie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been talking to you?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She admitted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will begin well,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
him.&nbsp; In a month he will have tired of it, and be clamouring
to do something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very disappointed in him if he does,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell him that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it may
help.&nbsp; People don&rsquo;t like other people to be
disappointed in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You could say that father will be disappointed in
him.&nbsp; Father formed rather a good opinion of him, I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell him,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;that we
shall all be disappointed in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She agreed to that, and we parted.&nbsp; I remembered, when
she was gone, that after all we had not settled terms.</p>
<p>Dick overtook me a little way from home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have settled your business,&rdquo; I told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good of you,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s on the
understanding that you throw yourself into the thing and work
hard.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, I shall be disappointed in you, I
tell you so frankly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, governor,&rdquo; he answered
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. St. Leonard will also be disappointed in you,
Dick,&rdquo; I informed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has formed a very
high opinion of you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t give him cause to change
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get on all right with him,&rdquo; answered
Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jolly old duffer, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Janie will also be disappointed in you,&rdquo; I
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she say that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She mentioned it casually,&rdquo; I explained:
&ldquo;though now I come to think of it she asked me not to say
so.&nbsp; What she wanted me to impress upon you was that her
father would be disappointed in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick walked beside me in silence for awhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;ve been a worry to you, dad,&rdquo; he
said at last</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to turn over a new leaf, dad,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to work hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About time,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had cold bacon for lunch that
day.&nbsp; There was not much of it.&nbsp; I took it to be the
bacon we had not eaten for breakfast.&nbsp; But on a clean dish
with parsley it looked rather neat.&nbsp; It did not suggest,
however, a lunch for four people, two of whom had been out all
the morning in the open air.&nbsp; There was some excuse for
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard before,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;of cold
fried bacon as a <i>hors d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a <i>hors d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>,&rdquo;
explained Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is all there is for
lunch.&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke in the quiet, passionless voice of
one who has done with all human emotion.&nbsp; She added that she
should not be requiring any herself, she having lunched
already.</p>
<p>Veronica, conveying by her tone and bearing the impression of
something midway between a perfect lady and a Christian martyr,
observed that she also had lunched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I had,&rdquo; growled Dick.</p>
<p>I gave him a warning kick.&nbsp; I could see he was on the way
to getting himself into trouble.&nbsp; As I explained to him
afterwards, a woman is most dangerous when at her meekest.&nbsp;
A man, when he feels his temper rising, takes every opportunity
of letting it escape.&nbsp; Trouble at such times he
welcomes.&nbsp; A broken boot-lace, or a shirt without a button,
is to him then as water in the desert.&nbsp; An only collar-stud
that will disappear as if by magic from between his thumb and
finger and vanish apparently into thin air is a piece of good
fortune sent on these occasions only to those whom the gods
love.&nbsp; By the time he has waddled on his hands and knees
twice round the room, broken the boot-jack raking with it
underneath the wardrobe, been bumped and slapped and kicked by
every piece of furniture that the room contains, and ended up by
stepping on that stud and treading it flat, he has not a bitter
or an angry thought left in him.&nbsp; All that remains of him is
sweet and peaceful.&nbsp; He fastens his collar with a
safety-pin, humming an old song the while.</p>
<p>Failing the gifts of Providence, the children&mdash;if in
health&mdash;can generally be depended upon to afford him an
opening.&nbsp; Sooner or later one or another of them will do
something that no child, when he was a boy, would have
dared&mdash;or dreamed of daring&mdash;to even so much as think
of doing.&nbsp; The child, conveying by expression that the
world, it is glad to say, is slowly but steadily growing in
sense, and pity it is that old-fashioned folks can&rsquo;t bustle
up and keep abreast of it, points out that firstly it has not
done this thing, that for various reasons&mdash;a few only of
which need be dwelt upon&mdash;it is impossible it could have
done this thing; that secondly it has been expressly requested to
do this thing, that wishful always to give satisfaction, it
has&mdash;at sacrifice of all its own ideas&mdash;gone out of its
way to do this thing; that thirdly it can&rsquo;t help doing this
thing, strive against fate as it will.</p>
<p>He says he does not want to hear what the child has got to say
on the subject&mdash;nor on any other subject, neither then nor
at any other time.&nbsp; He says there&rsquo;s going to be a new
departure in this house, and that things all round are going to
be very different.&nbsp; He suddenly remembers every rule and
regulation he has made during the past ten years for the guidance
of everybody, and that everybody, himself included, has
forgotten.&nbsp; He tries to talk about them all at once, in
haste lest he should forget them again.&nbsp; By the time he has
succeeded in getting himself, if nobody else, to understand
himself, the children are swarming round his knees extracting
from him promises that in his sober moments he will be sorry that
he made.</p>
<p>I knew a woman&mdash;a wise and good woman she was&mdash;who
when she noticed that her husband&rsquo;s temper was causing him
annoyance, took pains to help him to get rid of it.&nbsp; To
relieve his sufferings I have known her search the house for a
last month&rsquo;s morning paper and, ironing it smooth, lay it
warm and neatly folded on his breakfast plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing in this world to be thankful for, at all
events, and that is that we don&rsquo;t live in
Ditchley-in-the-Marsh,&rdquo; he would growl ten minutes later
from the other side of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds a bit damp,&rdquo; the good woman would
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damp!&rdquo; he would grunt, &ldquo;who minds a bit of
damp!&nbsp; Good for you.&nbsp; Makes us Englishmen what we
are.&nbsp; Being murdered in one&rsquo;s bed about once a week is
what I should object to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they do much of that sort of thing down
there?&rdquo; the good woman would enquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be the chief industry of the place.&nbsp; Do
you mean to say you don&rsquo;t remember that old maiden lady
being murdered by her own gardener and buried in the
fowl-run?&nbsp; You women! you take no interest in public
affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do remember something about it, now you mention it,
dear,&rdquo; the good woman would confess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Always
seems such an innocent type of man, a gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be a special breed of them at
Ditchley-in-the-Marsh,&rdquo; he answers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here again
last Monday,&rdquo; he continues, reading with growing
interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Almost the same case&mdash;even to the
pruning knife.&nbsp; Yes, hanged if he
doesn&rsquo;t!&mdash;buries her in the fowl-run.&nbsp; This is
most extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the imitative instinct asserting
itself,&rdquo; suggests the good woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;As you,
dear, have so often pointed out, one crime makes
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always said so,&rdquo; he agrees; &ldquo;it has
always been a theory of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He folds the paper over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dull dogs, these
political chaps!&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the
Duke of Devonshire, speaking last night at Hackney, begins by
telling a funny story he says he has just heard about a
parrot.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s the same story somebody told a
month ago; I remember reading it.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;upon my
soul&mdash;word for word, I&rsquo;d swear to it.&nbsp; Shows you
the sort of men we&rsquo;re governed by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect everyone, dear, to possess your
repertoire,&rdquo; the good woman remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s just heard it that
afternoon, anyhow,&rdquo; responds the good man.</p>
<p>He turns to another column.&nbsp; &ldquo;What the devil!&nbsp;
Am I going off my head?&rdquo;&nbsp; He pounces on the eldest
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;When was the Oxford and Cambridge
Boat-race?&rdquo; he fiercely demands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Oxford and Cambridge Boat-race!&rdquo; repeats the
astonished youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s over.&nbsp; You
took us all to see it, last month.&nbsp; The Saturday
before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation for the next ten minutes he conducts himself,
unaided.&nbsp; At the end he is tired, maybe a trifle
hoarse.&nbsp; But all his bad temper is gone.&nbsp; His sorrow is
there was not sufficient of it.&nbsp; He could have done with
more.</p>
<p>Woman knows nothing of simple mechanics.&nbsp; A woman thinks
you can get rid of steam by boxing it up and sitting on the
safety-valve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeling as I do this morning, that I&rsquo;d like to
wring everybody&rsquo;s neck for them,&rdquo; the average woman
argues to herself; &ldquo;my proper course&mdash;I see it
clearly&mdash;is to creep about the house, asking of everyone
that has the time to spare to trample on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She coaxes you to tell her of her faults.&nbsp; When you have
finished she asks for more&mdash;reminds you of one or two you
had missed out.&nbsp; She wonders why it is that she is always
wrong.&nbsp; There must be a reason for it; if only she could
discover it.&nbsp; She wonders how it is that people can put up
with her&mdash;thinks it so good of them.</p>
<p>At last, of course, the explosion happens.&nbsp; The awkward
thing is that neither she herself nor anyone else knows when it
is coming.&nbsp; A husband cornered me one evening in the
club.&nbsp; It evidently did him good to talk.&nbsp; He told me
that, finding his wife that morning in one of her rare listening
moods, he had seized the opportunity to mention one or two
matters in connection with the house he would like to have
altered; that was, if she had no objection.&nbsp; She
had&mdash;quite pleasantly&mdash;reminded him the house was his,
that he was master there.&nbsp; She added that any wish of his of
course was law to her.</p>
<p>He was a young and inexperienced husband; it seemed to him a
hopeful opening.&nbsp; He spoke of quite a lot of
things&mdash;things about which he felt that he was right and she
was wrong.&nbsp; She went and fetched a quire of paper, and
borrowed his pencil and wrote them down.</p>
<p>Later on, going through his letters in the study, he found an
unexpected cheque; and ran upstairs and asked her if she would
not like to come out with him and get herself a new hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have understood it,&rdquo; he moaned, &ldquo;if
she had dropped on me while I was&mdash;well, I suppose, you
might say lecturing her.&nbsp; She had listened to it like a
lamb&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t opened her mouth except to say
&lsquo;yes, dear,&rsquo; or &lsquo;no, dear.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then,
when I only asked her if she&rsquo;d like a new hat, she goes
suddenly raving mad.&nbsp; I never saw a woman go so
mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I doubt if there be anything in nature quite as unexpected as
a woman&rsquo;s temper, unless it be tumbling into a hole.&nbsp;
I told all this to Dick.&nbsp; I have told it him before.&nbsp;
One of these days he will know it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right to be angry with me,&rdquo; Robina
replied meekly; &ldquo;there is no excuse for me.&nbsp; The whole
thing is the result of my own folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her pathetic humility should have appealed to him.&nbsp; He
can be sympathetic, when he isn&rsquo;t hungry.&nbsp; Just then
he happened to be hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left you making a pie,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It looked to me a fair-sized pie.&nbsp; There was a duck
on the table, with a cauliflower and potatoes; Veronica was up to
her elbows in peas.&nbsp; It made me hungry merely passing
through the kitchen.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to eat
in the town for fear of spoiling my appetite.&nbsp; Where is it
all?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you and Veronica have
eaten the whole blessed lot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is one thing&mdash;she admits it herself&mdash;that
exhausts Veronica&rsquo;s patience: it is unjust suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look as if I&rsquo;d eaten anything for hours and
hours?&rdquo; Veronica demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can feel my
waistband if you don&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said just now you had had your lunch,&rdquo; Dick
argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I did,&rdquo; Veronica admitted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One minute you are told that it is wicked to tell lies;
the next&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica!&rdquo; Robina interrupted threateningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy for you,&rdquo; retorted
Veronica.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not a growing child.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The least you can do,&rdquo; said Robina, &ldquo;is to
keep silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good,&rdquo; said Veronica&mdash;not
without reason.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell them when
I&rsquo;ve gone to bed, and can&rsquo;t put in a word for
myself.&nbsp; Everything is always my fault.&nbsp; I wish
sometimes that I was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I were dead,&rdquo; I corrected her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The verb &lsquo;to wish,&rsquo; implying uncertainty,
should always be followed by the conditional mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought,&rdquo; said Robina, &ldquo;to be thankful to
Providence that you&rsquo;re not dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are sorry when you&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; said
Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s some bread-and-cheese in the
house,&rdquo; suggested Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The baker, for some reason or another, has not called
this morning,&rdquo; Robina answered sweetly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Neither unfortunately has the grocer.&nbsp; Everything
there is to eat in the house you see upon the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accidents will happen,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
philosopher&mdash;as our friend St. Leonard would tell
us&mdash;only smiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could smile,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;if it were his
lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cultivate,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a sense of
humour.&nbsp; From a humorous point of view this lunch is rather
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have anything to eat at the St.
Leonards&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a glass or so of beer and a sandwich or
two,&rdquo; I admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;They brought it out to us
while we were talking in the yard.&nbsp; To tell the truth, I was
feeling rather peckish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick made no answer, but continued to chew bacon-rind.&nbsp;
Nothing I could say seemed to cheer him.&nbsp; I thought I would
try religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dinner of herbs&mdash;the sentiment applies equally
to lunch&mdash;and contentment therewith is better,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;than a stalled ox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about oxen,&rdquo; he interrupted
fretfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I feel I could just eat one&mdash;a plump
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a man I know.&nbsp; I confess he irritates me.&nbsp;
His argument is that you should always rise from a meal feeling
hungry.&nbsp; As I once explained to him, you cannot rise from a
meal feeling hungry without sitting down to a meal feeling
hungry; which means, of course, that you are always hungry.&nbsp;
He agreed with me.&nbsp; He said that was the idea&mdash;always
ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;rise from a meal
feeling no more interest in their food.&nbsp; That was a mental
attitude injurious to digestion.&nbsp; Keep it always interested;
that was the proper way to treat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By &lsquo;it&rsquo; you mean . . . ?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I myself;&rdquo; he explained&mdash;&ldquo;I rise
from breakfast feeling eager for my lunch.&nbsp; I get up from my
lunch looking forward to my dinner.&nbsp; I go to bed just ready
for my breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheerful expectancy, he said, was a wonderful aid to
digestion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I call myself;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a
cheerful feeder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to be
anything else.&nbsp; You talk like a tadpole.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t
you any other interest in life?&nbsp; What about home, and
patriotism, and Shakespeare&mdash;all those sort of things?&nbsp;
Why not give it a square meal, and silence it for an hour or two;
leave yourself free to think of something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you think of anything,&rdquo; he argued,
&ldquo;when your stomach&rsquo;s out of order?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you think of anything,&rdquo; I argued,
&ldquo;when it takes you all your time to keep it in order?&nbsp;
You are not a man; you are a nurse to your own
stomach.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were growing excited, both of us,
forgetting our natural refinement.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
get even your one afternoon a week.&nbsp; You are healthy enough,
I admit it.&nbsp; So are the convicts at Portland.&nbsp; They
never suffer from indigestion.&nbsp; I knew a doctor once who
prescribed for a patient two years&rsquo; penal servitude as the
only thing likely to do him permanent good.&nbsp; Your stomach
won&rsquo;t let you smoke.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t let you
drink&mdash;not when you are thirsty.&nbsp; It allows you a glass
of Apenta water at times when you don&rsquo;t want it, assuming
there could ever be a time when you did want it.&nbsp; You are
deprived of your natural victuals, and made to live upon prepared
food, as though you were some sort of a prize chicken.&nbsp; You
are sent to bed at eleven, and dressed in hygienic clothing that
makes no pretence to fit you.&nbsp; Talk of being
hen-pecked!&nbsp; Why, the mildest husband living would run away
or drown himself, rather than remain tied for the rest of his
existence to your stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy to sneer,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sneering,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I am
sympathising with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he did not want any sympathy.&nbsp; He said if only I
would give up over-eating and drinking myself, it would surprise
me how bright and intelligent I should become.</p>
<p>I thought this man might be of use to us on the present
occasion.&nbsp; Accordingly I spoke of him and of his
theory.&nbsp; Dick seemed impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice sort of man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An earnest man,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
practises what he preaches, and whether because, or in spite of
it, the fact remains that a chirpier soul I am sure does not
exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married?&rdquo; demanded Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A single man,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;In all
things an idealist.&nbsp; He has told me he will never marry
until he can find his ideal woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Robina here!&rdquo; suggested Dick.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Seem to have been made for one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina smiled.&nbsp; It was a wan, pathetic smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even he,&rdquo; thought Robina, &ldquo;would want his
beans cooked to time, and to feel that a reasonable supply of
nuts was always in the house.&nbsp; We incompetent women never
ought to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had finished the bacon.&nbsp; Dick said he would take a
stroll into the town.&nbsp; Robina suggested he might take
Veronica with him, that perhaps a bun and a glass of milk would
do the child no harm.</p>
<p>Veronica for a wonder seemed to know where all her things
were.&nbsp; Before Dick had filled his pipe she was ready dressed
and waiting for him.&nbsp; Robina said she would give them a list
of things they might bring back with them.&nbsp; She also asked
Dick to get together a plumber, a carpenter, a bricklayer, a
glazier, and a civil engineer, and to see to it that they started
off at once.&nbsp; She thought that among them they might be able
to do all that was temporarily necessary, but the great thing was
that the work should be commenced without delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what on earth&rsquo;s the matter, old girl?&rdquo;
asked Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you had an accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was that Robina exploded.&nbsp; I had been wondering
when it would happen.&nbsp; To Dick&rsquo;s astonishment it
happened then.</p>
<p>Yes, she answered, there had been an accident.&nbsp; Did he
suppose that seven scrimpy scraps of bacon was her notion of a
lunch between four hungry persons?&nbsp; Did he, judging from
himself, imagine that our family yielded only lunatics?&nbsp; Was
it kind&mdash;was it courteous to his parents, to the mother he
pretended to love, to the father whose grey hairs he was by his
general behaviour bringing down in sorrow to the grave&mdash;to
assume without further enquiry that their eldest daughter was an
imbecile?&nbsp; (My hair, by-the-bye, is not grey.&nbsp; There
may be a suggestion of greyness here and there, the natural
result of deep thinking.&nbsp; To describe it in the lump as grey
is to show lack of observation.&nbsp; And at forty-eight&mdash;or
a trifle over&mdash;one is not going down into the grave, not
straight down.&nbsp; Robina when excited uses exaggerated
language.&nbsp; I did not, however, interrupt her; she meant
well.&nbsp; Added to which, interrupting Robina, when&mdash;to
use her own expression&mdash;she is tired of being a worm, is
like trying to stop a cyclone with an umbrella.)&nbsp; Had his
attention been less concentrated on the guzzling of cold bacon
(he had only had four mouthfuls, poor fellow)&mdash;had he
noticed the sweet patient child starving before his very eyes
(this referred to Veronica)&mdash;his poor elder sister, worn out
with work and worry, pining for nourishment herself, it might
have occurred to even his intelligence that there had been an
accident.&nbsp; The selfishness, the egotism of men it was that
staggered, overwhelmed Robina, when she came to think of it.</p>
<p>Robina paused.&nbsp; Not for want of material, I judged, so
much as want of breath.&nbsp; Veronica performed a useful service
by seizing the moment to express a hope that it was not
early-closing day.&nbsp; Robina felt a conviction that it was: it
would be just like Dick to stand there dawdling in a corner till
it was too late to do anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been trying to get out of this corner for the
last five minutes,&rdquo; explained Dick, with that angelic smile
of his that I confess is irritating.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you have
done talking, and will give me an opening, I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina told him that she had done talking.&nbsp; She gave him
her reasons for having done talking.&nbsp; If talking to him
would be of any use she would often have felt it her duty to talk
to him, not only with regard to his stupidity and selfishness and
general aggravatingness, but with reference to his character as a
whole.&nbsp; Her excuse for not talking to him was the crushing
conviction of the hopelessness of ever effecting any improvement
in him.&nbsp; Were it otherwise&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously speaking,&rdquo; said Dick, now escaped from
his corner, &ldquo;something, I take it, has gone wrong with the
stove, and you want a sort of general smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the kitchen door and looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What was
it&mdash;an earthquake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked in over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it could not have been an earthquake,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We should have felt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not an earthquake,&rdquo; explained Robina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is your youngest daughter&rsquo;s notion of making
herself useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina spoke severely.&nbsp; I felt for the moment as if I had
done it all myself.&nbsp; I had an uncle who used to talk like
that.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your aunt,&rdquo; he would say, regarding me
with a reproachful eye, &ldquo;your aunt can be, when she likes,
the most trying woman to live with I have ever
known.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would depress me for days.&nbsp; I would
wonder whether I ought to speak to her about it, or whether I
should be doing only harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did she do it?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is impossible that a mere child&mdash;where is the
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parlour contained but Robina.&nbsp; I hurried to the door;
Dick was already half across the field.&nbsp; Veronica I could
not see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are making haste,&rdquo; Dick shouted back,
&ldquo;in case it is early-closing day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want Veronica!&rdquo; I shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; shouted Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica!&rdquo; I shouted with my hands to my
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; shouted Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s on
ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was useless screaming any more.&nbsp; He was now climbing
the stile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They always take each other&rsquo;s part, those
two,&rdquo; sighed Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you are just as bad,&rdquo; I told her;
&ldquo;if he doesn&rsquo;t, you do.&nbsp; And then if it&rsquo;s
you they take your part.&nbsp; And you take his part.&nbsp; And
he takes both your parts.&nbsp; And between you all I am just
getting tired of bringing any of you up.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Which is
the truth.)&nbsp; &ldquo;How did this thing happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had got everything finished,&rdquo; answered
Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;The duck was in the oven with the pie; the
peas and potatoes were boiling nicely.&nbsp; I was feeling hot,
and I thought I could trust Veronica to watch the things for
awhile.&nbsp; She promised not to play King Alfred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Robina&mdash;&ldquo;King Alfred
and the cakes.&nbsp; I left her one afternoon last year when we
were on the houseboat to watch some buns.&nbsp; When I came back
she was sitting in front of the fire, wrapped up in the
table-cloth, with Dick&rsquo;s banjo on her knees and a cardboard
crown upon her head.&nbsp; The buns were all burnt to a
cinder.&nbsp; As I told her, if I had known what she wanted to be
up to I could have given her some extra bits of dough to make
believe with.&nbsp; But oh, no! if you please, that would not
have suited her at all.&nbsp; It was their being real buns, and
my being real mad, that was the best part of the game.&nbsp; She
is an uncanny child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the game this time?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was intended for a
game&mdash;not at first,&rdquo; answered Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
went into the wood to pick some flowers for the table.&nbsp; I
was on my way back, still at some distance from the house, when I
heard quite a loud report.&nbsp; I took it for a gun, and
wondered what anyone would be shooting in July.&nbsp; It must be
rabbits, I thought.&nbsp; Rabbits never seem to have any time at
all to themselves, poor things.&nbsp; And in consequence I did
not hurry myself.&nbsp; It must have been about twenty minutes
later when I came in sight of the house.&nbsp; Veronica was in
the garden deep in confabulation with an awful-looking boy,
dressed in nothing but rags.&nbsp; His face and hands were almost
black.&nbsp; You never saw such an object.&nbsp; They both seemed
very excited.&nbsp; Veronica came to meet me; and with a face as
serious as mine is now, stood there and told me the most
barefaced pack of lies you ever heard.&nbsp; She said that a few
minutes after I had gone, robbers had come out of the
wood&mdash;she talked about them as though there had been
hundreds&mdash;and had with the most awful threats demanded to be
admitted into the house.&nbsp; Why they had not lifted the latch
and walked in, she did not explain.&nbsp; It appeared this
cottage was their secret rendezvous, where all their treasure
lies hidden.&nbsp; Veronica would not let them in, but shouted
for help: and immediately this awful-looking boy, to whom she
introduced me as &lsquo;Sir Robert&rsquo; something or another,
had appeared upon the scene; and then there had
followed&mdash;well, I have not the patience to tell you the
whole of the rigmarole they had concocted.&nbsp; The upshot of it
was that the robbers, defeated in their attempt to get into the
house, had fired a secret mine, which had exploded in the
kitchen.&nbsp; If I did not believe them I could go into the
kitchen and see for myself.&nbsp; Say what I would, that is the
story they both stuck to.&nbsp; It was not till I had talked to
Veronica for a quarter of an hour, and had told her that you
would most certainly communicate with the police, and that she
would have to convince a judge and jury of the truth of her
story, that I got any sense at all out of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the sense you did get out of her?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not sure even now that it is the
truth,&rdquo; said Robina&mdash;&ldquo;the child does not seem to
possess a proper conscience.&nbsp; What she will grow up like, if
something does not happen to change her, it is awful to
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to appear a hustler,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and maybe I am mistaken in the actual time, but it feels
to me like hours since I asked you how the catastrophe really
occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am telling you,&rdquo; explained Robina, hurt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was in the kitchen yesterday when I mentioned to
Harry&rsquo;s mother, who had looked in to help me wash up, that
the kitchen chimney smoked: and then she said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she did,&rdquo; answered Robina,
&ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; She said that very often a
pennyworth of gunpowder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now at last we have begun,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;From this point I may be able to help you, and we will get
on.&nbsp; At the word &lsquo;gunpowder&rsquo; Veronica pricked up
her ears.&nbsp; The thing by its very nature would appeal to
Veronica&rsquo;s sympathies.&nbsp; She went to bed dreaming of
gunpowder.&nbsp; Left in solitude before the kitchen fire, other
maidens might have seen pictured in the glowing coals, princes,
carriages, and balls.&nbsp; Veronica saw visions of
gunpowder.&nbsp; Who knows?&mdash;perhaps even she one day will
have gunpowder of her own!&nbsp; She looks up from her reverie: a
fairy godmamma in the disguise of a small boy&mdash;it was a
small boy, was it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a nice little boy, he gave me the idea of having
been, originally,&rdquo; answered Robina; &ldquo;the child, I
should say, of well-to-do parents.&nbsp; He was dressed in a
little Lord Fauntleroy suit&mdash;or rather, he had
been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Veronica know how he was&mdash;anything about
him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I could get out of her,&rdquo; replied
Robina; &ldquo;you know her way&mdash;how she chums on with
anybody and everybody.&nbsp; As I told her, if she had been
attending to her duties instead of staring out of the window, she
would not have seen him.&nbsp; He happened to be crossing the
field just at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy born to ill-luck, evidently,&rdquo; I
observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;To Veronica of course he seemed like the
answer to a prayer.&nbsp; A boy would surely know where gunpowder
could be culled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have got a pound of it from somewhere,&rdquo;
said Robina, &ldquo;judging from the result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any notion where they got it from?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; explained Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;All Veronica
can say is that he told her he knew where he could get some, and
was gone about ten minutes.&nbsp; Of course they must have stolen
it&mdash;even that did not seem to trouble her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came to her as a gift from the gods, Robina,&rdquo;
I explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I remember how I myself used to feel
about these things, at ten.&nbsp; To have enquired further would
have seemed to her impious.&nbsp; How was it they were not both
killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; was Robina&rsquo;s suggestion: it
seemed to be the only one possible.&nbsp; &ldquo;They lifted off
one of the saucepans and just dropped the thing
in&mdash;fortunately wrapped up in a brown paper parcel, which
gave them both time to get out of the house.&nbsp; At least
Veronica got clear off.&nbsp; For a change it was not she who
fell over the mat, it was the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked again into the kitchen; then I returned and put my
hands on Robina&rsquo;s shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a most
amusing incident&mdash;as it has turned out,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have turned out rather seriously,&rdquo;
thought Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; I agreed: &ldquo;she might be lying
upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a wicked, heartless child,&rdquo; said Robina;
&ldquo;she ought to be punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lent Robina my handkerchief; she never has one of her
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is going to be punished,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I
will think of something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so ought I,&rdquo; said Robina; &ldquo;it was my
fault, leaving her, knowing what she&rsquo;s like.&nbsp; I might
have murdered her.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s stuffing herself with cakes at this very
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will probably give her indigestion,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you have better children?&rdquo;
sobbed Robina; &ldquo;we are none of us any good to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not the children I wanted, I confess,&rdquo; I
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice kind thing to say!&rdquo; retorted
Robina indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted such charming children,&rdquo; I
explained&mdash;&ldquo;my idea of charming children: the children
I had imagined for myself.&nbsp; Even as babies you disappointed
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina looked astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Robina, were the most disappointing,&rdquo; I
complained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dick was a boy.&nbsp; One does not
calculate upon boy angels; and by the time Veronica arrived I had
got more used to things.&nbsp; But I was so excited when you
came.&nbsp; The Little Mother and I would steal at night into the
nursery.&nbsp; &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful,&rsquo; the Little
Mother would whisper, &lsquo;to think it all lies hidden there:
the little tiresome child, the sweetheart they will one day take
away from us, the wife, the mother?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am glad
it is a girl,&rsquo; I would whisper; &lsquo;I shall be able to
watch her grow into womanhood.&nbsp; Most of the girls one comes
across in books strike one as not perhaps quite true to
life.&nbsp; It will give me such an advantage having a girl of my
own.&nbsp; I shall keep a note-book, with a lock and key, devoted
to her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; asked Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it away,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;there were but
a few pages written on.&nbsp; It came to me quite early in your
life that you were not going to be the model heroine.&nbsp; I was
looking for the picture baby, the clean, thoughtful baby, with
its magical, mystical smile.&nbsp; I wrote poetry about you,
Robina, but you would slobber and howl.&nbsp; Your little nose
was always having to be wiped, and somehow the poetry did not
seem to fit you.&nbsp; You were at your best when you were
asleep, but you would not even sleep when it was expected of
you.&nbsp; I think, Robina, that the fellows who draw the
pictures for the comic journals of the man in his night-shirt
with the squalling baby in his arms must all be single men.&nbsp;
The married man sees only sadness in the design.&nbsp; It is not
the mere discomfort.&nbsp; If the little creature were ill or in
pain we should not think of that.&nbsp; It is the reflection that
we, who meant so well, have brought into the world just an
ordinary fretful human creature with a nasty temper of its own:
that is the tragedy, Robina.&nbsp; And then you grew into a
little girl.&nbsp; I wanted the soulful little girl with the
fathomless eyes, who would steal to me at twilight and question
me concerning life&rsquo;s conundrums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I used to ask you questions,&rdquo; grumbled
Robina, &ldquo;and you would tell me not to be silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand, Robina?&rdquo; I
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not blaming you, I am blaming
myself.&nbsp; We are like children who plant seeds in a garden,
and then are angry with the flowers because they are not what we
expected.&nbsp; You were a dear little girl; I see that now,
looking back.&nbsp; But not the little girl I had in my
mind.&nbsp; So I missed you, thinking of the little girl you were
not.&nbsp; We do that all our lives, Robina.&nbsp; We are always
looking for the flowers that do not grow, passing by, trampling
underfoot, the blossoms round about us.&nbsp; It was the same
with Dick.&nbsp; I wanted a naughty boy.&nbsp; Well, Dick was
naughty, no one can say that he was not.&nbsp; But it was not my
naughtiness.&nbsp; I was prepared for his robbing orchards.&nbsp;
I rather hoped he would rob orchards.&nbsp; All the high-spirited
boys in books rob orchards, and become great men.&nbsp; But there
were not any orchards handy.&nbsp; We happened to be living in
Chelsea at the time he ought to have been robbing orchards: that,
of course, was my fault.&nbsp; I did not think of that.&nbsp; He
stole a bicycle that a lady had left outside the tea-room in
Battersea Park, he and another boy, the son of a common barber,
who shaved people for three-halfpence.&nbsp; I am a Republican in
theory, but it grieved me that a son of mine could be drawn to
such companionship.&nbsp; They contrived to keep it for a
week&mdash;till the police found it one night, artfully hidden
behind bushes.&nbsp; Logically, I do not see why stealing apples
should be noble and stealing bicycles should be mean, but it
struck me that way at the time.&nbsp; It was not the particular
steal I had been hoping for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted him wild; the hero of the book was ever in his
college days a wild young man.&nbsp; Well, he was wild.&nbsp; It
cost me three hundred pounds to keep that breach of promise case
out of Court; I had never imagined a breach of promise
case.&nbsp; Then he got drunk, and bonneted a bishop in mistake
for a &lsquo;bull-dog.&rsquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t mind the
bishop.&nbsp; That by itself would have been wholesome fun.&nbsp;
But to think that a son of mine should have been
drunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has never been drunk since,&rdquo; pleaded
Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had only three glasses of champagne and a
liqueur: it was the liqueur&mdash;he was not used to it.&nbsp; He
got into the wrong set.&nbsp; You cannot in college belong to the
wild set without getting drunk occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; I admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
book the wild young man drinks without ever getting drunk.&nbsp;
Maybe there is a difference between life and the book.&nbsp; In
the book you enjoy your fun, but contrive somehow to escape the
licking: in life the licking is the only thing sure.&nbsp; It was
the wild young man of fiction I was looking for, who, a fortnight
before the exam., ties a wet towel round his head, drinks strong
tea, and passes easily with honours.&nbsp; He tried the wet
towel, he tells me.&nbsp; It never would keep in its place.&nbsp;
Added to which it gave him neuralgia; while the strong tea gave
him indigestion.&nbsp; I used to picture myself the proud,
indulgent father lecturing him for his wildness&mdash;turning
away at some point in the middle of my tirade to hide a
smile.&nbsp; There was never any smile to hide.&nbsp; I feel that
he has behaved disgracefully, wasting his time and my
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going to turn over a new leaf;&rdquo; said
Robina: &ldquo;I am sure he will make an excellent
farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not want a farmer,&rdquo; I explained; &ldquo;I
wanted a Prime Minister.&nbsp; Children, Robina, are very
disappointing.&nbsp; Veronica is all wrong.&nbsp; I like a
mischievous child.&nbsp; I like reading stories of mischievous
children: they amuse me.&nbsp; But not the child who puts a pound
of gunpowder into a red-hot fire, and escapes with her life by a
miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, I daresay,&rdquo; suggested Robina,
&ldquo;that if one put it into a book&mdash;I mean that if you
put it into a book, it would read amusingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely enough,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Other
people&rsquo;s troubles can always be amusing.&nbsp; As it is, I
shall be in a state of anxiety for the next six months,
wondering, every moment that she is out of my sight, what new
devilment she is up to.&nbsp; The Little Mother will be worried
out of her life, unless we can keep it from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children will be children,&rdquo; murmured Robina,
meaning to be comforting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I am complaining of, Robina.&nbsp; We are
always hoping that ours won&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; She is full of
faults, Veronica, and they are not always nice faults.&nbsp; She
is lazy&mdash;lazy is not the word for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is lazy,&rdquo; Robina was compelled to admit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are other faults she might have had and
welcome,&rdquo; I pointed out; &ldquo;faults I could have taken
an interest in and liked her all the better for.&nbsp; You
children are so obstinate.&nbsp; You will choose your own
faults.&nbsp; Veronica is not truthful always.&nbsp; I wanted a
family of little George Washingtons, who could not tell a
lie.&nbsp; Veronica can.&nbsp; To get herself out of
trouble&mdash;and provided there is any hope of anybody believing
her&mdash;she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all of us used to when we were young,&rdquo; Robina
maintained; &ldquo;Dick used to, I used to.&nbsp; It is a common
fault with children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not
want a child with common faults.&nbsp; I wanted something all my
own.&nbsp; I wanted you, Robina, to be my ideal daughter.&nbsp; I
had a girl in my mind that I am sure would have been
charming.&nbsp; You are not a bit like her.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
say she was perfect, she had her failings, but they were such
delightful failings&mdash;much better than yours, Robina.&nbsp;
She had a temper&mdash;a woman without a temper is insipid; but
it was that kind of temper that made you love her all the
more.&nbsp; Yours doesn&rsquo;t, Robina.&nbsp; I wish you had not
been in such a hurry, and had left me to arrange your temper for
you.&nbsp; We should all of us have preferred mine.&nbsp; It had
all the attractions of temper without the drawbacks of the
ordinary temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t use it up, I suppose, for yourself,
Pa?&rdquo; suggested Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a lady&rsquo;s temper,&rdquo; I explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; as I asked her, &ldquo;what is wrong with
the one I have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Robina.&nbsp; Yet her tone
conveyed doubt.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems to me sometimes that an
older temper would suit you better, that was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have hinted as much before, Robina,&rdquo; I
remarked, &ldquo;not only with reference to my temper, but with
reference to things generally.&nbsp; One would think that you
were dissatisfied with me because I am too young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in years perhaps,&rdquo; replied Robina,
&ldquo;but&mdash;well, you know what I mean.&nbsp; One wants
one&rsquo;s father to be always great and dignified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot change our ego,&rdquo; I explained to
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some daughters would appreciate a father
youthful enough in temperament to sympathise with and to indulge
them.&nbsp; The solemn old fogey you have in your mind would have
brought you up very differently.&nbsp; Let me tell you that, my
girl.&nbsp; You would not have liked him, if you had had
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Robina agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
awfully good in some ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we have got to do in this world, Robina,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;is to take people as they are, and make the best of
them.&nbsp; We cannot expect everybody to be just as we would
have them, and maybe we should not like them any better if they
were.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t bother yourself about how much nicer they
might be; think how nice they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina said she would try.&nbsp; I have hopes of making Robina
a sensible woman.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> and Veronica returned laden
with parcels.&nbsp; They explained that &ldquo;Daddy Slee,&rdquo;
as it appeared he was generally called, a local builder of
renown, was following in his pony-cart, and was kindly bringing
the bulkier things with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to hustle him,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;but
coming up after he had washed himself and had his tea seemed to
be his idea of hustling.&nbsp; He has got the reputation of being
an honest old Johnny, slow but sure; the others, they tell me,
are slower.&nbsp; I thought you might care, later on, to talk to
him about the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica took off her things and put them away, each one in
its proper place.&nbsp; She said, if no one wanted her, she would
read a chapter of &ldquo;The Vicar of Wakefield,&rdquo; and
retired upstairs.&nbsp; Robina and I had an egg with our tea; Mr.
Slee arrived as we had finished, and I took him straight into the
kitchen.&nbsp; He was a large man, with a dreamy expression and a
habit of sighing.&nbsp; He sighed when he saw our kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s four days&rsquo; work for three men
here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll want a new
stove.&nbsp; Lord! what trouble children can be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robina agreed with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;how am I to
cook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself, missie,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Slee, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see how you are going to cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all have to tramp home again,&rdquo;
thought Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tell Little Mother the reason, and frighten her out
of her life!&rdquo; retorted Robina indignantly.</p>
<p>Robina had other ideas.&nbsp; Mr. Slee departed, promising
that work should be commenced at seven o&rsquo;clock on Monday
morning.&nbsp; Robina, the door closed, began to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Pa have a sandwich,&rdquo; said Robina, &ldquo;and
catch the six-fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might all have a sandwich,&rdquo; suggested Dick;
&ldquo;I could do with one myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa can explain,&rdquo; said Robina, &ldquo;that he has
been called back to town on business.&nbsp; That will account for
everything, and Little Mother will not be alarmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t believe that business has brought him
back at nine o&rsquo;clock on a Saturday night,&rdquo; argued
Dick; &ldquo;you think that Little Mother hasn&rsquo;t any
sense.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll see there&rsquo;s something up, and ask
a hundred questions.&nbsp; You know what she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa,&rdquo; said Robina, &ldquo;will have time while in
the train to think out something plausible; that&rsquo;s where Pa
is clever.&nbsp; With Pa off my hands I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
mind.&nbsp; We three can live on cold ham and things like
that.&nbsp; By Thursday we will be all right, and then he can
come down again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pointed out to Robina, kindly but firmly, the utter
absurdity of her idea.&nbsp; How could I leave them, three
helpless children, with no one to look after them?&nbsp; What
would the Little Mother say?&nbsp; What might not Veronica be up
to in my absence?&nbsp; There were other things to be
considered.&nbsp; The donkey might arrive at any moment&mdash;no
responsible person there to receive him&mdash;to see to it that
his simple wants would be provided for.&nbsp; I should have to
interview Mr. St. Leonard again to fix up final details as
regarded Dick.&nbsp; Who was going to look after the cow, about
to be separated from us?&nbsp; Young Bute would be down again
with plans.&nbsp; Who was going to take him over the house,
explain things to him intelligibly?&nbsp; The new boy might turn
up&mdash;this simple son of the soil Miss Janie had promised to
dig out and send along.&nbsp; He would talk Berkshire.&nbsp; Who
would there be to understand him&mdash;to reply to him in
dialect?&nbsp; What was the use of her being impetuous and
talking nonsense?</p>
<p>She went on cutting sandwiches.&nbsp; She said they were not
helpless children.&nbsp; She said if she and Dick at forty-two
hadn&rsquo;t grit enough to run a six-roomed cottage it was time
they learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s forty-two?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; explained Robina, &ldquo;Dick and
I&mdash;between us.&nbsp; We shall be forty-two next
birthday.&nbsp; Nearly your own age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;for the next few
days won&rsquo;t be a child at all.&nbsp; She knows nothing of
the happy medium.&nbsp; She is either herself or she goes to the
opposite extreme, and tries to be an angel.&nbsp; Till about the
end of the week it will be like living with a vision.&nbsp; As
for the donkey, we&rsquo;ll try and make him feel as much at home
as if you were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude, Pa,&rdquo; Robina
explained, &ldquo;but from the way you put it you evidently
regard yourself as the only one among us capable of interesting
him.&nbsp; I take it he won&rsquo;t mind for a night or two
sharing the shed with the cow.&nbsp; If he looks shocked at the
suggestion, Dick can knock up a partition.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather
for the present, till you come down again, the cow stopped where
she was.&nbsp; She helps to wake me in the morning.&nbsp; You may
reckon you have settled everything as far as Dick is
concerned.&nbsp; If you talk to St. Leonard again for an hour it
will be about the future of the Yellow Races or the possibility
of life in Jupiter.&nbsp; If you mention terms he will be
insulted, and if he won&rsquo;t let you then you will be
insulted, and the whole thing will be off.&nbsp; Let me talk to
Janie.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve both of us got sense.&nbsp; As for Mr.
Bute, I know all your ideas about the house, and I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t listen to any of his silly arguments.&nbsp;
What that young man wants is someone to tell him what he&rsquo;s
got to do, and then let there be an end of it.&nbsp; And the
sooner that handy boy turns up the better.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
mind what he talks.&nbsp; All I want him to do is to clean knives
and fetch water and chop wood.&nbsp; At the worst I&rsquo;ll get
that home to him by pantomime.&nbsp; For conversation he can wait
till you come down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is the gist of what she said.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t run
exactly as I have put it down.&nbsp; There were points at which I
interrupted, but Robina never listens; she just talks on, and at
the end she assumes that, as a matter of course, you have come
round to her point of view, and persuading her that you
haven&rsquo;t means beginning the whole thing over again.</p>
<p>She said I hadn&rsquo;t time to talk, and that she would write
and tell me everything.&nbsp; Dick also said he would write and
tell me everything; and that if I felt moved to send them down a
hamper&mdash;the sort of thing that, left to themselves, Fortnum
&amp; Mason would put together for a good-class picnic, say, for
six persons&mdash;I might rely upon it that nothing would be
wasted.</p>
<p>Veronica, by my desire, walked with me to the end of the
lane.&nbsp; I talked to her very seriously.&nbsp; Her difficulty
was that she had not been blown up.&nbsp; Had she been blown up,
then she would have known herself she had done wrong.&nbsp; In
the book it is the disobedient child that is tossed by the
bull.&nbsp; The child that has been sent with the little basket
to visit the sick aunt may be right in the bull&rsquo;s
way.&nbsp; That is a bit of bad luck for the bull.&nbsp; The poor
bull is compelled to waste valuable time working round carefully,
so as not to upset the basket.&nbsp; If the wicked child had
sense (which in the book does not happen), it would, while the
bull was dodging to get past the good child, seize the
opportunity to move itself quickly.&nbsp; The wicked child never
looks round, but pegs along steadily; and when the bull arrives
it is sure to be in the most convenient position for receiving
moral lessons.&nbsp; The good child, whatever its weight, crosses
the ice in safety.&nbsp; The bad child may turn the scale at two
stone lighter; the ice will have none of him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk to me about relative pressure to the
square inch,&rdquo; says the indignant ice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were
unkind to your little baby brother the week before last: in you
go.&rdquo;&nbsp; Veronica&rsquo;s argument, temperately and
courteously expressed, I admit, came practically to this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have acted without sufficient knowledge to guide
me.&nbsp; My education has not, perhaps, on the whole, been
ordered wisely.&nbsp; Subjects that I feel will never be of the
slightest interest or consequence to me have been insisted upon
with almost tiresome reiteration.&nbsp; Matters that should be
useful and helpful to me&mdash;gunpowder, to take but one
example&mdash;I have been left in ignorance concerning.&nbsp;
About all that I say nothing; people have done their best
according to their lights, no doubt.&nbsp; When, however, we come
to purity of motives, singleness of intention, then, I maintain,
I am above reproach.&nbsp; The proof of this is that Providence
has bestowed upon me the seal of its approval: I was not blown
up.&nbsp; Had my conduct been open to censure&mdash;as in certain
quarters has been suggested&mdash;should I be walking besides you
now, undamaged&mdash;not a hair turned, as the saying is?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; Discriminating Fate&mdash;that is, if any reliance at
all is to be placed on literature for the young&mdash;would have
made it her business that at least I was included in the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i>.&nbsp; Instead, what do we notice!&mdash;a
shattered chimney, a ruined stove, broken windows, a wreckage of
household utensils; I, alone of all things, miraculously
preserved.&nbsp; I do not wish to press the point offensively,
but really it would almost seem that it must be you
three&mdash;you, my dear parent, upon whom will fall the bill for
repairs; Dick, apt to attach too much importance, maybe, to his
victuals, and who for the next few days will be compelled to
exist chiefly upon tinned goods; Robina, by nature of a worrying
disposition, certain till things get straight again to be next
door to off her head&mdash;who must, by reason of conduct into
which I do not enquire, have merited chastisement at the hands of
Providence.&nbsp; The moral lesson would certainly appear to be
between you three.&nbsp; I&mdash;it grows clear to me&mdash;have
been throughout but the innocent instrument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Admit the premise that to be virtuous is to escape whipping,
the argument is logical.&nbsp; I felt that left uncombated it
might lead us into yet further trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the time has come to
reveal to you a secret: literature is not always a safe guide to
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; said Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that the writer of books
is, generally speaking, an exceptionally moral man.&nbsp; That is
what leads him astray: he is too good.&nbsp; This world does not
come up to his ideas.&nbsp; It is not the world as he would have
made it himself.&nbsp; To satisfy his craving for morality he
sets to work to make a world of his own.&nbsp; It is not this
world.&nbsp; It is not a bit like this world.&nbsp; In a world as
it should be, Veronica, you would undoubtedly have been blown
up&mdash;if not altogether, at all events partially.&nbsp; What
you have to do, Veronica, is, with a full heart, to praise Heaven
that this is not a perfect world.&nbsp; If it were I doubt very
much, Veronica, your being here.&nbsp; That you are here happy
and thriving proves that all is not as it should be.&nbsp; The
bull of this world, feeling he wants to toss somebody, does not
sit upon himself, so to speak, till the wicked child comes
by.&nbsp; He takes the first child that turns up, and thanks God
for it.&nbsp; A hundred to one it is the best child for miles
around.&nbsp; The bull does not care.&nbsp; He spoils that
pattern child.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d spoil a bishop, feeling as he
does that morning.&nbsp; Your little friend in the velvet suit
who did get himself blown up, at all events as regards the
suit&mdash;&nbsp; Which of you was it that thought of that
gunpowder, you or he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica claimed that the inspiration had been hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can easily believe it.&nbsp; And was he anxious to
steal the gunpowder and put it on the fire, or did he have to be
persuaded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica admitted that in the qualities of a first-class hero
he was wanting.&nbsp; Not till it had been suggested to him that
he must at heart be a cowardy cowardy custard had he been moved
to take a hand in the enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lad, clearly,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;that left to
himself would be a comfort to his friends.&nbsp; And the story of
the robbers&mdash;your invention or his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica was generously of opinion that he might have thought
of it had he not been chiefly concerned at the moment with the
idea of getting home to his mother.&nbsp; As it was, the clothing
with romance of incidents otherwise bald and uninteresting had
fallen upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good child of the story.&nbsp; The fact stands out
at every point.&nbsp; His one failing an amiable weakness.&nbsp;
Do you not see it for yourself; Veronica?&nbsp; In the book, you,
not he, would have tumbled over the mat.&nbsp; In this wicked
world it is the wicked who prosper.&nbsp; He, the innocent, the
virtuous, is torn into rags.&nbsp; You, the villain of the story,
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Veronica; &ldquo;then whenever
nothing happens to you that means that you&rsquo;re a wrong
&rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go so far as to say that, Veronica.&nbsp;
And I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t use slang.&nbsp; Dick is a man, and
a man&mdash;well, never mind about a man.&nbsp; You, Veronica,
must never forget that you&rsquo;re a lady.&nbsp; Justice must
not be looked for in this world.&nbsp; Sometimes the wicked get
what they deserve.&nbsp; More often they don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There
seems to be no rule.&nbsp; Follow the dictates of your
conscience, Veronica, and blow&mdash;I mean be indifferent to the
consequences.&nbsp; Sometimes you&rsquo;ll come out all right,
and sometimes you won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But the beautiful sensation
will always be with you: I did right.&nbsp; Things have turned
out unfortunately: but that&rsquo;s not my fault.&nbsp; Nobody
can blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they do,&rdquo; said Veronica, &ldquo;they blame
you just as if you&rsquo;d meant to go and do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not matter, Veronica,&rdquo; I pointed out,
&ldquo;the opinion of the world.&nbsp; The good man disregards
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they send you to bed,&rdquo; persisted
Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is bed so
long as the voice of the inward Monitor consoles us with the
reflection&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted Veronica;
&ldquo;it makes you feel all the madder.&nbsp; It does
really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It oughtn&rsquo;t to,&rdquo; I told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why does it?&rdquo; argued Veronica.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t it do what it ought to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trouble about arguing with children is that they will
argue too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s a difficult problem, Veronica,&rdquo; I
allowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Things are not as they ought to be, I admit
it.&nbsp; But one must not despair.&nbsp; Something&rsquo;s got
to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s jolly hard on some of us,&rdquo; said
Veronica.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strive as you may, you can&rsquo;t please
everyone.&nbsp; And if you just as much as stand up for yourself,
oh, crikey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duty of the grown-up person, Veronica,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;is to bring up the child in the way that it should
go.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t easy work, and occasionally irritability
may creep in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a lot of &rsquo;em at it,&rdquo;
grumbled Veronica.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are times, between
&rsquo;em all, when you don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re
standing on your head or your heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mean well, Veronica,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I was a little boy I used to think just as you
do.&nbsp; But now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever get into rows?&rdquo; interrupted
Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I ever?&mdash;was never out of them, so far as I
can recollect.&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t one thing, then it was
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t it make you wild?&rdquo; enquired
Veronica, &ldquo;when first of all they&rsquo;d ask what
you&rsquo;d got to say and why you&rsquo;d done it, and then,
when you tried to explain things to them, wouldn&rsquo;t listen
to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What used to irritate me most, Veronica,&rdquo; I
replied&mdash;&ldquo;I can remember it so well&mdash;was when
they talked steadily for half an hour themselves, and then, when
I would attempt with one sentence to put them right about the
thing, turn round and bully-rag me for being
argumentative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they would only listen,&rdquo; agreed Veronica,
&ldquo;you might get them to grasp things.&nbsp; But no, they
talk and talk, till at the end they don&rsquo;t know what they
are talking about themselves, and then they pretend it&rsquo;s
your fault for having made them tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;they always end up like
that.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am tired of talking to you,&rsquo; they
say&mdash;as if we were not tired of listening to
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then when you think,&rdquo; said Veronica,
&ldquo;they say you oughtn&rsquo;t to think.&nbsp; And if you
don&rsquo;t think, and let it out by accident, then they say
&lsquo;why don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo;&nbsp; It don&rsquo;t
seem as though we could do right.&nbsp; It makes one almost
despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t even as if they were always right
themselves,&rdquo; I pointed out to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;When they
knock over a glass it is, &lsquo;Who put that glass
there?&rsquo;&nbsp; You&rsquo;d think that somebody had put it
there on purpose and made it invisible.&nbsp; They are not
expected to see a glass six inches in front of their nose, in the
place where the glass ought to be.&nbsp; The way they talk
you&rsquo;d suppose that a glass had no business on a
table.&nbsp; If I broke it, then it was always, &lsquo;Clumsy
little devil! ought to have his dinner in the
nursery.&rsquo;&nbsp; If they mislay their things and can&rsquo;t
find them, it&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s been interfering with
my things?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s been in here rummaging
about?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then when they find it they want to know
indignantly who put it there.&nbsp; If I could not find a thing,
for the simple reason that somebody had taken it away and put it
somewhere else, then wherever they had put it was the right place
for it, and I was a little idiot for not knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course you mustn&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo;
commented Veronica.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; If they do
something silly and you just point it out to them, then there is
always a reason for it that you wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp;
Oh, yes!&nbsp; And if you make just the slightest mistake, like
what is natural to all of us, that is because you are wicked and
unfeeling and don&rsquo;t want to be anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what we will do, Veronica,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;we will write a book.&nbsp; You shall help me.&nbsp;
And in it the children shall be the wise and good people who
never make mistakes, and they shall boss the show&mdash;you know
what I mean&mdash;look after the grown-up people and bring them
up properly.&nbsp; And everything the grown-up people do, or
don&rsquo;t do, will be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica clapped her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, will you
really?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will really,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will
call it a moral tale for parents; and all the children will buy
it and give it to their fathers and mothers and such-like folk
for their birthdays, with writing on the title-page, &lsquo;From
Johnny, or Jenny, to dear Papa, or to dear Aunty, with every good
wish for his or her improvement!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they will read it?&rdquo; doubted
Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will put in it something shocking,&rdquo; I
suggested, &ldquo;and get some paper to denounce it as a disgrace
to English literature.&nbsp; And if that won&rsquo;t do it we
will say it is a translation from the Russian.&nbsp; The children
shall stop at home and arrange what to have for dinner, and the
grown-up people shall be sent to school.&nbsp; We will start them
off each morning with a little satchel.&nbsp; They shall be made
to read &lsquo;Grimm&rsquo;s Fairy Tales&rsquo; in the original
German, with notes; and learn &lsquo;Old Mother Hubbard&rsquo; by
heart and explain the grammar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And go to bed early,&rdquo; suggested Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have them all in bed by eight o&rsquo;clock,
Veronica, and they will go cheerfully, as if they liked it, or we
will know the reason why.&nbsp; We will make them say their
prayers.&nbsp; Between ourselves, Veronica, I don&rsquo;t believe
they always do.&nbsp; And no reading in bed, and no final glass
of whisky toddy, or any nonsense of that sort.&nbsp; An Abernethy
biscuit and perhaps if they are good a jujube, and then
&lsquo;Good night,&rsquo; and down with their head on the
pillow.&nbsp; And no calling out, and no pretending they have got
a pain in their tummy and creeping downstairs in their
night-shirts and clamouring for brandy.&nbsp; We will be up to
all their tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll have to take their medicine,&rdquo;
Veronica remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The slightest suggestion of sulkiness, the first
intimation that they are not enjoying themselves, will mean cod
liver oil in a tablespoon, Veronica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will ask them why they never use their
commonsense,&rdquo; chirped Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be our trouble, Veronica; that they
won&rsquo;t have any sense of any sort&mdash;not what we shall
deem sense.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, we will be just.&nbsp; We
will always give them a reason why they have got to do everything
they don&rsquo;t want to do, and nothing that they want to
do.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t understand it and they won&rsquo;t
agree that it is a reason; but they will keep that to themselves,
if they are wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course they must not argue,&rdquo; Veronica
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they answer back, Veronica, that will show they are
cursed with an argumentative temperament which must be rooted out
at any cost,&rdquo; I agreed; &ldquo;and if they don&rsquo;t say
anything, that will prove them possessed of a surly disposition
which must be checked at once, before it develops into a
vice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whatever we do to them we will tell them it&rsquo;s
for their own good,&rdquo; Veronica chortled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it will be for their own good,&rdquo; I
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;That will be our chief
pleasure&mdash;making them good and happy.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t
be their pleasure, but that will be owing to their
ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be grateful to us later on,&rdquo; gurgled
Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that assurance we will comfort them from time to
time,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will be good to them in
all ways.&nbsp; We will let them play games&mdash;not stupid
games, golf and croquet, that do you no good and lead only to
language and dispute&mdash;but bears and wolves and whales;
educational sort of games that will aid them in acquiring
knowledge of natural history.&nbsp; We will show them how to play
Pirates and Red Indians and Ogres&mdash;sensible play that will
help them to develop their imaginative faculties.&nbsp; That is
why grown-up people are so dull; they are never made to
think.&nbsp; But now and then,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;we will
let them play their own games, say on Wednesday and Saturday
afternoons.&nbsp; We will invite other grown-ups to come to tea
with them, and let them flirt in the garden, or if wet make love
in the dining-room, till nurse comes for them.&nbsp; But we, of
course, must choose their friends for them&mdash;nice,
well-behaved ladies and gentlemen, the parents of respectable
children; because left to themselves&mdash;well, you know what
they are!&nbsp; They would just as likely fall in love with quite
undesirable people&mdash;men and women we could not think of
having about the house.&nbsp; We will select for them companions
we feel sure will be the most suitable for them; and if they
don&rsquo;t like them&mdash;if Uncle William says he can&rsquo;t
bear the girl we have invited up to love him&mdash;that he
positively hates her, we till tell him that it is only his wilful
temper, and that he&rsquo;s got to like her because she&rsquo;s
good for him; and don&rsquo;t let us have any of his
fretfulness.&nbsp; And if Grandmamma pouts and says she
won&rsquo;t love old man Jones merely because he&rsquo;s got a
red nose, or a glass eye, or some silly reason of that sort, we
will say to her: &lsquo;All right, my lady, you will play with
Mr. Jones and be nice to him, or you will spend the afternoon
putting your room tidy; make up your mind.&rsquo;&nbsp; We will
let them marry (on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons), and play
at keeping house.&nbsp; And if they quarrel we will shake them
and take the babies away from them, and lock them up in drawers,
and tell them they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have them again till they
are good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the more they try to be good, the more it will turn
out that they ain&rsquo;t been good,&rdquo; Veronica
reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their goodness and their badness will depend upon us in
more senses than one, Veronica,&rdquo; I explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When Consols are down, when the east wind has touched up
our liver, they will be surprised how bad they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they mustn&rsquo;t ever forget what they&rsquo;ve
ever been once told,&rdquo; crowed Veronica.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
mustn&rsquo;t have to tell &rsquo;em the same thing over and over
again, like we was talking to brick walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we meant to tell them and forgot to tell
them,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;we will tell them that they ought
not to want us to tell them a simple thing like that, as if they
were mere babies.&nbsp; We must remember all these
points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they grumble we&rsquo;ll tell them that&rsquo;s
&rsquo;cos they don&rsquo;t know how happy they are.&nbsp; And
we&rsquo;ll tell them how good we used to be when&mdash;I say,
don&rsquo;t you miss your train, or I shall get into a
row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d forgotten all about that
train, Veronica,&rdquo; I admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better run,&rdquo; suggested Veronica.</p>
<p>It sounded good advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on thinking about that book,&rdquo; shouted
Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a note of things as they occur to you,&rdquo; I
shouted back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we call it?&rdquo; Veronica screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why the Man in the Moon looks sat
upon,&rsquo;&rdquo; I shrieked.</p>
<p>When I turned again she was sitting on the top rail of the
stile conducting an imaginary orchestra with one of her own
shoes.&nbsp; The six-fifteen was fortunately twenty minutes
late.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I thought it best to tell Ethelbertha the truth; that things
had gone wrong with the kitchen stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me know the worst,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
Veronica hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is that I shall have
to pay for a new range.&nbsp; Why, when anything goes amiss, poor
Veronica should be assumed as a matter of course to be in it,
appears to me unjust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure she&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo; persisted
Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest Injun&mdash;confound those children and their
slang&mdash;I mean positively,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; The
Little Mother looked relieved.</p>
<p>I told her all the trouble we had had in connection with the
cow.&nbsp; Her sympathies were chiefly with the cow.&nbsp; I told
her I had hopes of Robina&rsquo;s developing into a sensible
woman.&nbsp; We talked quite a deal about Robina.&nbsp; We agreed
that between us we had accomplished something rather clever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get back as soon as I can,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want young Bute getting wrong ideas into his
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is young Bute?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The architect,&rdquo; I explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he was an old man,&rdquo; said
Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Spreight is old enough,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Young Bute is one of his young men; but he understands his
work, and seems intelligent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally, an exceedingly nice young fellow.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a good deal of sense in him.&nbsp; I like a boy who
listens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-looking?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not objectionably so,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
pleasant face&mdash;particularly when he smiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he married?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, it did not occur to me to ask him,&rdquo; I
admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;How curious you women are!&nbsp; No, I
don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp; I should say not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t give you
the idea of a married man.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll like him.&nbsp;
Seems so fond of his sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we be seeing much of him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A goodish deal,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
expect he will be going down on Monday.&nbsp; Very annoying, this
stove business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of his being there without you?&rdquo;
Ethelbertha wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll potter round,&rdquo; I suggested,
&ldquo;and take measurements.&nbsp; Dick will be about to explain
things to him.&nbsp; Or, if he isn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s
Robina&mdash;awkward thing is, Robina seems to have taken a
dislike to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why has she taken a dislike to him?&rdquo; asked
Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because he mistook the back of the house for the
front, or the front of the house for the back,&rdquo; I
explained; &ldquo;I forget which now.&nbsp; Says it&rsquo;s his
smile that irritates her.&nbsp; She owns herself there&rsquo;s no
real reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you be going down again?&rdquo; Ethelbertha
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Thursday next,&rdquo; I told her; &ldquo;stove or no
stove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said she would come with me.&nbsp; She felt the change
would do her good, and promised not to do anything when she got
there.&nbsp; And then I told her all that I had done for
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ordinary farmer,&rdquo; I pointed out to her,
&ldquo;is so often a haphazard type of man with no ideas.&nbsp;
If successful, it is by reason of a natural instinct which cannot
be taught.&nbsp; St. Leonard has studied the theory of the
thing.&nbsp; From him Dick will learn all that can be learnt
about farming.&nbsp; The selection, I felt, demanded careful
judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will Dick stick to it?&rdquo; Ethelbertha
wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, again,&rdquo; I pointed out to her, &ldquo;the
choice was one calling for exceptional foresight.&nbsp; The old
man&mdash;as a matter of fact, he isn&rsquo;t old at all;
can&rsquo;t be very much older than myself; I don&rsquo;t know
why they all call him the old man&mdash;has formed a high opinion
of Dick.&nbsp; His daughter told me so, and I have taken care to
let Dick know it.&nbsp; The boy will not care to disappoint
him.&nbsp; Her mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose mother?&rdquo; interrupted Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janie&rsquo;s mother, Mrs. St. Leonard,&rdquo; I
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;She also has formed a good opinion of
him.&nbsp; The children like him.&nbsp; Janie told me
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to do a goodish deal of talking, this Miss
Janie,&rdquo; remarked Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will like her,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is a
charming girl&mdash;so sensible, and good, and unselfish,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you all this about her?&rdquo; interrupted
Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see it for yourself,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The mother appears to be a nonentity, and St. Leonard
himself&mdash;well, he is not a business man.&nbsp; It is Janie
who manages everything&mdash;keeps everything going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is she like?&rdquo; asked Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am telling you,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is so
practical, and yet at the same time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In appearance, I mean,&rdquo; explained
Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you women,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do worry about
mere looks!&nbsp; What does it matter?&nbsp; If you want to know,
it is that sort of face that grows upon you.&nbsp; At first you
do not notice how beautiful it is, but when you come to look into
it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has she also formed a high opinion of Dick?&rdquo;
interrupted Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be disappointed in him,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;if he does not work hard and stick to it.&nbsp; They will
all be disappointed in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it got to do with them?&rdquo; demanded
Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking about them,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What I look at is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her,&rdquo; said Ethelbertha.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t seem to be
listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that class of man,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and
the wife appears, if anything, to be worse.&nbsp; As for the
girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you come to know them&mdash;&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She said she didn&rsquo;t want to know them.&nbsp; She wanted
to go down on Monday, early.</p>
<p>I got her to see&mdash;it took some little time&mdash;the
disadvantages of this.&nbsp; We should only be adding to
Robina&rsquo;s troubles; and change of plan now would unsettle
Dick&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has promised to write me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
tell me the result of his first day&rsquo;s experience.&nbsp; Let
us wait and hear what he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said that whatever could have possessed her to let me take
those poor unfortunate children away from her, and muddle up
everything without her, was a mystery to herself.&nbsp; She hoped
that, at least, I had done nothing irrevocable in the case of
Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is really wishful, I
think, to improve.&nbsp; I have bought her a donkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; exclaimed Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A donkey,&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;The child
took a fancy to it, and we all agreed it might help to steady
her&mdash;give her a sense of responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I somehow felt you hadn&rsquo;t overlooked
Veronica,&rdquo; said Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>I thought it best to change the conversation.&nbsp; She seemed
in a fretful mood.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Robina&rsquo;s</span> letter was dated
Monday evening, and reached us Tuesday morning.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you caught your train,&rdquo; she wrote.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Veronica did not get back till half-past six.&nbsp; She
informed me that you and she had found a good deal to talk about,
and that &lsquo;one thing had led to another.&rsquo;&nbsp; She is
a quaint young imp, but I think your lecture must have done her
good.&nbsp; Her present attitude is that of gentle forbearance to
all around her&mdash;not without its dignity.&nbsp; She has not
snorted once, and at times is really helpful.&nbsp; I have given
her an empty scribbling diary we found in your desk, and most of
her spare time she remains shut up with it in the bedroom.&nbsp;
She tells me you and she are writing a book together.&nbsp; I
asked her what about.&nbsp; She waved me aside with the assurance
that I would know &lsquo;all in good time,&rsquo; and that it was
going to do good.&nbsp; I caught sight of just the title-page
last night.&nbsp; It was lying open on the dressing-table:
&lsquo;Why the Man in the Moon looks sat upon.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
sounds like a title of yours.&nbsp; But I would not look further,
though tempted.&nbsp; She has drawn a picture underneath.&nbsp;
It is really not bad.&nbsp; The old gentleman really does look
sat upon, and intensely disgusted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir Robert&rsquo;&mdash;his name being Theodore,
which doesn&rsquo;t seem to suit him&mdash;turns out to be the
only son of a widow, a Mrs. Foy, our next-door neighbour to the
south.&nbsp; We met her coming out of church on Sunday
morning.&nbsp; She was still crying.&nbsp; Dick took Veronica on
ahead, and I walked part of the way home with them.&nbsp; Her
grandfather, it appears, was killed many years ago by the
bursting of a boiler; and she is haunted, poor lady, by the
conviction that Theodore is the inheritor of an hereditary
tendency to getting himself blown up.&nbsp; She attaches no blame
to us, seeing in Saturday&rsquo;s catastrophe only the hand of
the Family Curse.&nbsp; I tried to comfort her with the idea that
the Curse having spent itself upon a futile effort, nothing
further need now be feared from it; but she persists in taking
the gloomier view that in wrecking our kitchen, Theodore&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Doom,&rsquo; as she calls it, was merely indulging in a
sort of dress rehearsal; the finishing performance may be relied
upon to follow.&nbsp; It sounds ridiculous, but the poor woman
was so desperately in earnest that when an unlucky urchin, coming
out of a cottage we were passing, tripped on the doorstep and let
fall a jug, we both screamed at the same time, and were equally
surprised to find &lsquo;Sir Robert&rsquo; still between us and
all in one piece.&nbsp; I thought it foolish to discuss all this
before the child himself; but did not like to stop her.&nbsp; As
a result, he regards himself evidently as the chosen foe of
Heaven, and is not, unnaturally, proud of himself.&nbsp; She
called here this (Monday) afternoon to leave cards; and, at her
request, I showed her the kitchen and the mat over which he had
stumbled.&nbsp; She seemed surprised that the &lsquo;Doom&rsquo;
had let slip so favourable a chance of accomplishing its
business, and gathered from the fact added cause for
anxiety.&nbsp; Evidently something much more thorough is in store
for Master Theodore.&nbsp; It was only half a pound of gunpowder,
she told me.&nbsp; Doctor Smallboy&rsquo;s gardener had bought it
for the purpose of raising the stump of an old elm-tree, and had
left it for a moment on the grass while he had returned to the
house for more brown paper.&nbsp; She seemed pleased with the
gardener, who, as she said, might, if dishonestly inclined, have
charged her for a pound.&nbsp; I wanted to pay for&mdash;at all
events&mdash;our share, but she would not take a penny.&nbsp; Her
late lamented grandfather she regards as the person responsible
for the entire incident, and perhaps it may be as well not to
disturb her view.&nbsp; Had I suggested it, I feel sure she would
have seen the justice of her providing us with a new kitchen
range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wildly exaggerated accounts of the affair are flying
round the neighbourhood; and my chief fear is that Veronica may
discover she is a local celebrity.&nbsp; Your sudden
disappearance is supposed to have been heavenward.&nbsp; An old
farm labourer who saw you pass on your way to the station speaks
of you as &lsquo;the ghost of the poor gentleman himself;&rsquo;
and fragments of clothing found anywhere within a radius of two
miles are being preserved, I am told, as specimens of your
remains.&nbsp; Boots would appear to have been your chief
apparel.&nbsp; Seven pairs have already been collected from the
surrounding ditches.&nbsp; Among the more public-spirited there
is talk of using you to start a local museum.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>These first three paragraphs I did not read to
Ethelbertha.&nbsp; Fortunately they just filled the first sheet,
which I took an opportunity of slipping into my pocket
unobserved.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;The new boy arrived on Sunday morning,&rdquo; she
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;His name&mdash;if I have got it
right&mdash;is William.&nbsp; Anyhow, that is the nearest I can
get to it.&nbsp; His other name, if any, I must leave you to
extract from him yourself.&nbsp; It may be Berkshire that he
talks, but it sounds more like barking.&nbsp; Please excuse the
pun; but I have just been talking to him for half an hour, trying
to make him understand that I want him to go home, and maybe, as
a result, I am feeling a little hysterical.&nbsp; Anything more
rural I cannot imagine.&nbsp; But he is anxious to learn, and a
fairly wide field is in front of him.&nbsp; I caught him after
our breakfast on Sunday calmly throwing everything left over onto
the dust-heap.&nbsp; I pointed out to him the wickedness of
wasting nourishing food, and impressed upon him that the proper
place for victuals was inside us.&nbsp; He never answers.&nbsp;
He stands stock still, with his mouth as wide open as it will
go&mdash;which is saying a good deal&mdash;and one trusts that
one&rsquo;s words are entering into him.&nbsp; All Sunday
afternoon he was struggling valiantly against an almost
supernatural sleepiness.&nbsp; After tea he got worse, and I
began to think he would be no use to me.&nbsp; We none of us ate
much supper; and Dick, who appears able to understand him, helped
him to carry the things out.&nbsp; I heard them talking, and then
Dick came back and closed the door behind him.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
wants to know,&rsquo; said Dick, &lsquo;if he can leave the
corned beef over till to-morrow.&nbsp; Because, if he eats it all
to-night, he doesn&rsquo;t think he will be able to walk
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica takes great interest in him.&nbsp; She has
evidently a motherly side to her character, for which we none of
us have given her credit.&nbsp; She says she is sure there is
good in him.&nbsp; She sits beside him while he chops wood, and
tells him carefully selected stories, calculated, she argues, to
develop his intelligence.&nbsp; She is careful, moreover, not to
hurt his feelings by any display of superiority.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of
course, anyone leading a useful life, such as yours,&rsquo; I
overheard her saying to him this morning, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
naturally get much time for reading.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve nothing
else to do, you see, &rsquo;cept to improve myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The donkey arrived this afternoon while I was
out&mdash;galloping, I am given to understand, with &rsquo;Opkins
on his back.&nbsp; There seems to be some secret between those
two.&nbsp; We have tried him with hay, and we have tried him with
thistles; but he seems to prefer bread-and-butter.&nbsp; I have
not been able as yet to find out whether he takes tea or coffee
in the morning.&nbsp; But he is an animal that evidently knows
his own mind, and fortunately both are in the house.&nbsp; We are
putting him up for to-night with the cow, who greeted him at
first with enthusiasm and wanted to adopt him, but has grown cold
to him since on discovering that he is not a calf.&nbsp; I have
been trying to make friends with her, but she is so very
unresponsive.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t seem to want anything but
grass, and prefers to get that for herself.&nbsp; She
doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to be happy ever again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A funny thing happened in church.&nbsp; I was
forgetting to tell you.&nbsp; The St. Leonards occupy two pews at
the opposite end from the door.&nbsp; They were all there when we
arrived, with the exception of the old gentleman himself.&nbsp;
He came in just before the &lsquo;Dearly Beloved,&rsquo; when
everybody was standing up.&nbsp; A running fire of suppressed
titters followed him up the aisle, and some of the people laughed
outright.&nbsp; I could see no reason why.&nbsp; He looked a
dignified old gentleman in his grey hair and tightly buttoned
frock coat, which gives him a somewhat military appearance.&nbsp;
But when he came level with our pew I understood.&nbsp; Hurrying
back from his morning round, and with no one there to superintend
him, the dear old absent-minded thing had forgotten to change his
breeches.&nbsp; From a little above the knee upward he was a
perfect Christian; but his legs were just those of a disreputable
sinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the joke?&rsquo; he whispered to me
as he passed&mdash;I was in the corner seat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have I
missed it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We called round on them after lunch, and at once I was
appealed to for my decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, here&rsquo;s a plain sensible girl,&rsquo;
exclaimed the old gentleman the moment I entered the
room.&rsquo;&nbsp; (You will notice I put no comma after
&lsquo;plain.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am taking it he did not intend
one.&nbsp; You can employ one adjective to qualify another,
can&rsquo;t you?)&nbsp; &lsquo;And I will put it to her, What
difference can it make to the Almighty whether I go to church in
trousers or in breeches?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not see,&rsquo; retorted Mrs. St. Leonard
somewhat coldly, &lsquo;that Miss Robina is in any better
position than myself to speak with authority on the views of the
Almighty&rsquo;&mdash;which I felt was true.&nbsp; &lsquo;If it
makes no difference to the Almighty, then why not, for my sake,
trousers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The essential thing,&rsquo; he persisted,
&lsquo;is a contrite heart.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was getting very
cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It may just as well be dressed
respectably,&rsquo; was his wife&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; He left
the room, slamming the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do like Janie the more and more I see of her.&nbsp; I
do hope she will let me get real chums with her.&nbsp; She does
me so much good.&nbsp; (I read that bit twice over to
Ethelbertha, pretending I had lost the place.)&nbsp; I suppose it
is having rather a silly mother and an unpractical father that
has made her so capable.&nbsp; If you and Little Mother had been
proper sort of parents I might have been quite a decent sort of
girl.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s too late finding fault with you
now.&nbsp; I suppose I must put up with you.&nbsp; She works so
hard, and is so unselfish.&nbsp; But she is not like some good
people, who make you feel it is hopeless your trying to be
good.&nbsp; She gets cross and impatient; and then she laughs at
herself, and gets right again that way.&nbsp; Poor Mrs. St.
Leonard!&nbsp; I cannot help feeling sorry for her.&nbsp; She
would have been so happy as the wife of a really respectable City
man, who would have gone off every morning with a flower in his
buttonhole and have worn a white waistcoat on Sundays.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t believe what they say: that husbands and wives should
be the opposite of one another.&nbsp; Mr. St. Leonard ought to
have married a brainy woman, who would have discussed philosophy
with him, and have been just as happy drinking beer out of a
tea-cup: you know the sort I mean.&nbsp; If ever I marry it will
be a short-tempered man who loves music and is a good dancer; and
if I find out too late that he&rsquo;s clever I&rsquo;ll run away
from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick has not yet come home&mdash;nearly eight
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Veronica is supposed to be in bed, but I can
hear things falling.&nbsp; Poor boy!&nbsp; I expect he&rsquo;ll
be tired; but to-day is an exception.&nbsp; Three hundred sheep
have had to be brought all the way from Ilsley, and must be
&lsquo;herded&rsquo;&mdash;I fancy it is called&mdash;before
anybody can think of supper.&nbsp; I saw to it that he had a good
dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now to come to business.&nbsp; Young Bute has been
here all day, and has only just left.&nbsp; He is coming down
again on Friday&mdash;which, by the way, don&rsquo;t forget is
Mrs. St. Leonard&rsquo;s &lsquo;At Home&rsquo; day.&nbsp; She
hopes she may then have the pleasure of making your acquaintance,
and thinks that possibly there may be present one or two people
we may like to know.&nbsp; From which I gather that half the
neighbourhood has been specially invited to meet you.&nbsp; So
mind you bring a frock-coat; and if Little Mother can put her
hand easily on my pink muslin with the spots&mdash;it is either
in my wardrobe or else in the bottom drawer in Veronica&rsquo;s
room, if it isn&rsquo;t in the cardboard box underneath
mother&rsquo;s bed&mdash;you might slip it into your bag.&nbsp;
But whatever you do don&rsquo;t crush it.&nbsp; The sash I feel
sure mother put away somewhere herself.&nbsp; He sees no
reason&mdash;I&rsquo;m talking now about young Bute,&mdash;if you
approve his plans, why work should not be commenced
immediately.&nbsp; Shall I write old Slee to meet you at the
house on Friday?&nbsp; From all accounts I don&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;ll do better.&nbsp; He is on the spot, and they say he
is most reasonable.&nbsp; But you have to get estimates,
don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; He suggests&mdash;Mr. Bute, I
mean&mdash;throwing what used to be the dairy into the passage,
which will make a hall big enough for anything.&nbsp; We might
even give a dance in it, he thinks.&nbsp; But all this you will
be able to discuss with him on Friday.&nbsp; He has evidently
taken a great deal of pains, and some of his suggestions sound
sensible.&nbsp; But of course he must fully understand that it is
what we want, not what he thinks, that is important.&nbsp; I told
him you said I could have my room exactly as I liked it myself;
and I have explained to him my ideas.&nbsp; He seemed at first to
be under the impression that I didn&rsquo;t know what I was
talking about, so I made it quite clear to him that I did, with
the result that he has consented to carry out my instructions, on
condition that I put them down in black and white&mdash;which I
think just as well, as then there can be no excuse afterwards for
argument.&nbsp; I like him better than I did the first
time.&nbsp; About everything else he can be fairly amiable.&nbsp;
It is when he talks about &lsquo;frontal elevations&rsquo; and
&lsquo;ground plans&rsquo; that he irritates me.&nbsp; Tell
Little Mother that I&rsquo;ll write her to-morrow.&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t she come down with you on Friday?&nbsp; Everything
will be ship-shape by then; and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remainder was of a nature more private.&nbsp; She
concluded with a postscript, which also I did not read to
Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I had finished telling you everything, when
quite a stylish rat-tat sounded on the door.&nbsp; I placed an
old straw hat of Dick&rsquo;s in a prominent position, called
loudly to an imaginary &lsquo;John&rsquo; not to go without the
letters, and then opened it.&nbsp; He turned out to be the local
reporter.&nbsp; I need not have been alarmed.&nbsp; He was much
the more nervous of the two, and was so full of excuses that had
I not come to his rescue I believe he would have gone away
forgetting what he&rsquo;d come for.&nbsp; Nothing save an
overwhelming sense of duty to the Public (with a capital P) could
have induced him to inflict himself upon me.&nbsp; Could I give
him a few details which would enable him to set rumour
right?&nbsp; I immediately saw visions of headlines:
&lsquo;Domestic Tragedy!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Eminent Author blown
up by his own Daughter!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Once Happy Home now a
Mere Wreck!&rsquo;&nbsp; It seemed to me our only plan was to
enlist this amiable young man upon our side; I hope I did not
overdo it.&nbsp; My idea was to convey the impression that one
glance at him had convinced me he was the best and noblest of
mankind; that I felt I could rely upon his wit and courage to
save us from a notoriety that, so far as I was concerned, would
sadden my whole life; and that if he did so eternal gratitude and
admiration would be the least I could lay at his feet.&nbsp; I
can be nice when I try.&nbsp; People have said so.&nbsp; We
parted with only a pressure of the hand, and I hope he
won&rsquo;t get into trouble, but I see <i>The Berkshire
Courier</i> is going to be deprived of its prey.&nbsp; Dick has
just come in.&nbsp; He promises to talk when he has finished
eating.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s letter, for which Ethelbertha seemed to be
strangely impatient, reached us on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever you want to find out, Dad, what hard work
really means, you try farming,&rdquo; wrote Dick; &ldquo;and yet
I believe you would like it.&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t some old Johnny
somewhere described it as the poetry of the ploughshare?&nbsp;
Why did we ever take to bothering about anything
else&mdash;shutting ourselves up in stuffy offices, worrying
ourselves to death about a lot of rubbish that isn&rsquo;t any
good to anybody?&nbsp; I wish I could put it properly, Dad; you
would see just what I mean.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t we live in
simply-built houses and get most everything we want out of the
land: which we easily could?&nbsp; You take a dozen poor devils
away from walking behind the plough and put them down into
coal-mines, and set them running about half-naked among a lot of
roaring furnaces, and between them they turn out a machine that
does the ploughing for them.&nbsp; What is the sense of it?&nbsp;
Of course some things are useful.&nbsp; I would like a motor-car,
and railways and steamboats are all right; but it seems to me
that half the fiddle-faddles we fancy we want we&rsquo;d be just
as well, if not better, without, and there would be all that time
and energy to spare for the sort of things that everybody ought
to have.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s everywhere just like it was at
school.&nbsp; They kept us so hard at it, studying Greek roots,
we hadn&rsquo;t time to learn English grammar.&nbsp; Look at
young Dennis Yewbury.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got two thousand acres up
in Scotland.&nbsp; He could lead a jolly life turning the place
into some real use.&nbsp; Instead of which he lets it all run to
waste for nothing but to breed a few hundred birds that
wouldn&rsquo;t keep a single family alive; while he works from
morning till night at humbugging people in a beastly hole in the
City, just to fill his house with a host of silly gim-cracks and
dress up himself and his women-folk like peacocks.&nbsp; Of
course we would always want clever chaps like you to tell us
stories; and doctors we couldn&rsquo;t do without, though I guess
if we were leading sensible lives we&rsquo;d be able to get along
with about half of them.&nbsp; It seems to me that what we want
is a comfortable home, enough to eat and drink, and a few fal-lal
sort of things to make the girls look pretty; and that all the
rest is rot.&nbsp; We would all of us have time then to think and
play a bit, and if we were all working fairly at something really
useful and were contented with our own share, there&rsquo;d be
enough for everybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose this is all nonsense, but I wish it
wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Anyway, it&rsquo;s what I mean to do myself;
and I&rsquo;m awfully much obliged to you, Dad, for giving me
this chance.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve hit the right nail on the head
this time.&nbsp; Farming was what I was meant for; I feel
it.&nbsp; I would have hated being a barrister, setting people by
the ears and making my living out of other people&rsquo;s
troubles.&nbsp; Being a farmer you feel that in doing good to
yourself you are doing good all round.&nbsp; Miss Janie agrees
with all I say.&nbsp; I think she is one of the most sensible
girls I have ever come across, and Robin likes her awfully.&nbsp;
So is the old man: he&rsquo;s a brick.&nbsp; I think he has taken
a liking to me, and I know I have to him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the
dearest old fellow imaginable.&nbsp; The very turnips he seems to
think of as though they were so many rows of little
children.&nbsp; And he makes you see the inside of things.&nbsp;
Take fields now, for instance.&nbsp; I used to think a field was
just a field.&nbsp; You scraped it about and planted it with
seeds, and everything else depended on the weather.&nbsp; Why,
Dad, it&rsquo;s alive!&nbsp; There are good fields that want to
get on&mdash;that are grateful for everything you do for them,
and take a pride in themselves.&nbsp; And there are brutes of
fields that you feel you want to kick.&nbsp; You can waste a
hundred pounds&rsquo; worth of manure on them, and it only makes
them more stupid than they were before.&nbsp; One of our
fields&mdash;a wizened-looking eleven-acre strip bordering the
Fyfield road&mdash;he has christened Mrs. Gummidge: it seems to
feel everything more than any other field.&nbsp; From whatever
point of the compass the wind blows that field gets the most harm
from it.&nbsp; You would think to look at it after a storm that
there hadn&rsquo;t been any rain in any other field&mdash;that
that particular field must have got it all; while two days&rsquo;
sunshine has the effect upon it that a six weeks&rsquo; drought
would on any other field.&nbsp; His theory (he must have a theory
to account for everything; it comforts him.&nbsp; He has just hit
upon a theory that explains why twins are born with twice as much
original sin as other children, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind
now what they do) is that each odd corner of the earth has gained
a character of its own from the spirits of the countless dead men
buried in its bosom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Robbers and thieves,&rsquo; he
will say, kicking the sod of some field all stones and thistles;
&lsquo;silly fighting men who thought God built the world merely
to give them the fun of knocking it about.&nbsp; Look at them,
the fools! stones and thistles&mdash;thistles and stones: that is
their notion of a field.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or, leaning over the gate
of some field of rich-smelling soil, he will stretch out his arms
as though to caress it: &lsquo;Brave lads!&rsquo; he will say;
&lsquo;kindly honest fellows who loved the poor peasant
folk.&rsquo;&nbsp; I fancy he has not got much sense of humour;
or if he has, it is a humour he leaves you to find out for
yourself.&nbsp; One does not feel one wants to laugh, listening
even to his most whimsical ideas; and anyhow it is a fact that of
two fields quite close to one another, one will be worth ten
pounds an acre and the other dear at half a crown, and there
seems to be nothing to explain it.&nbsp; We have a seven-acre
patch just halfway up the hill.&nbsp; He says he never passes it
without taking off his hat to it.&nbsp; Whatever you put in it
does well; while other fields, try them with what you will, it is
always the very thing they did not want.&nbsp; You might fancy
them fractious children, always crying for the other
child&rsquo;s bun.&nbsp; There is really no reason for its being
such a good field, except its own pluck.&nbsp; It faces the east,
and the wood for half the day hides it from the sun; but it makes
the best of everything, and even on the greyest day it seems to
be smiling at you.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some happy-hearted Mother
Thing&mdash;a singer of love songs the while she toiled,&rsquo;
he will have it, must lie sleeping there.&nbsp; By-the-bye, what
a jolly field Janie would make!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think so,
Dad?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the dickens, Dad, have you done to Veronica?&nbsp;
She wanders about everywhere with an exercise book in her hand,
and when you say anything to her, instead of answering you back,
she sits plump down wherever she is and writes for all
she&rsquo;s worth.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t say what she&rsquo;s up
to.&nbsp; She says it&rsquo;s a private matter between you and
her, and that later on things are going to be seen in their true
light.&nbsp; I told her this morning what I thought of her for
forgetting to feed the donkey.&nbsp; I was prepared, of course,
for a hundred explanations: First, that she had meant to feed the
donkey; secondly, that it wasn&rsquo;t her place to feed the
donkey; thirdly, that the donkey would have been fed if
circumstances over which she had no control had not arisen
rendering it impossible for her to feed the donkey; fourthly,
that the morning wasn&rsquo;t the proper time to feed the donkey,
and so on.&nbsp; Instead of which, out she whips this ridiculous
book and asks me if I would mind saying it over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep forgetting to ask Janie what it is he has been
accustomed to.&nbsp; We have tried him with thistles, and
we&rsquo;ve tried him with hay.&nbsp; The thistles he scratches
himself against; but for the hay he appears to have no use
whatever.&nbsp; Robin thinks his idea is to save us
trouble.&nbsp; We are not to get in anything especially for
him&mdash;whatever we may happen to be having ourselves he will
put up with.&nbsp; Bread-and-butter cut thick, or a slice of cake
with an apple seems to be his notion of a light lunch; and for
drink he fancies tea out of a slop-basin, with two knobs of sugar
and plenty of milk.&nbsp; Robin says it&rsquo;s waste of time
taking his meals out to him.&nbsp; She says she is going to train
him to come in when he hears the gong.&nbsp; We use the alarm
clock at present for a gong.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what I
shall do when the cow goes away.&nbsp; She wakes me every morning
punctually at half-past four, but I&rsquo;m in a blue funk that
one of these days she will oversleep herself.&nbsp; It is one of
those clocks you read about.&nbsp; You wrote something rather
funny about one once yourself, but I always thought you had
invented it.&nbsp; I bought it because they said it was an extra
loud one, and so it is.&nbsp; The thing that&rsquo;s wrong about
it is that, do what you will, you can&rsquo;t get it to go off
before six o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; I set it on Sunday
evening for half-past four&mdash;we farmers do have to work, I
can tell you.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s worth it.&nbsp; I had no idea
that the world was so beautiful.&nbsp; There is a light you never
see at any other time, and the whole air seems to be full of
fluttering song.&nbsp; You feel&mdash;but you must get up and
come out with me, Dad.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t describe it.&nbsp; If
it hadn&rsquo;t been for the good old cow, Lord knows what time
I&rsquo;d have been up.&nbsp; The clock went off at half-past
four in the afternoon, just as they were sitting down to tea, and
frightened them all out of their skins.&nbsp; We have fiddled
about with it all we know, but there&rsquo;s no getting it to do
anything between six p.m. and six am.&nbsp; Anything you want of
it in the daytime it is quite agreeable to.&nbsp; But it seems to
have fixed its own working hours, and isn&rsquo;t going to be
bustled out of its proper rest.&nbsp; I got so mad with it myself
I wanted to pitch it out of the window, but Robin thought we
ought to keep it till you came, that perhaps you might be able to
do something with it&mdash;writing something about it, she
means.&nbsp; I said I thought alarm clocks were pretty well
played out by this time; but, as she says, there is always a new
generation coming along to whom almost everything must be
fresh.&nbsp; Anyhow, the confounded thing cost seven and six, and
seems to be no good for anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever was it that you really did say to Robin about
her room?&nbsp; Young Bute came round to me on Monday quite upset
about it.&nbsp; He says it is going to be all windows, and will
look, when finished, like an incorrect copy of the Eddystone
lighthouse.&nbsp; He says there will be no place for the bed, and
if there is to be a fireplace at all it will have to be in the
cupboard, and that the only way, so far as he can see, of her
getting in and out of it will be by a door through the
bathroom.&nbsp; She said that you said she could have it entirely
to her own idea, and that he was just to carry out her
instructions; but, as he points out, you can&rsquo;t have a room
in a house as if the rest of the house wasn&rsquo;t there, even
if it is your own room.&nbsp; Nobody, it seems, will be able to
have a bath without first talking it over with her, and arranging
a time mutually convenient.&nbsp; I told him I was sure you never
meant him to do anything absurd; and that his best plan would be
to go straight back to her, explain to her that she&rsquo;d been
talking like a silly goat&mdash;he could have put it politely, of
course&mdash;and that he wasn&rsquo;t going to pay any attention
to her.&nbsp; You might have thought I had suggested his walking
into a den of lions and pulling all their tails.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what Robin has done to him, but he seems quite
frightened of her.&nbsp; I had to promise that I would talk to
her.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d better have done it himself.&nbsp; I only
told her just what he said, and off she went in one of her
tantrums.&nbsp; You know her style: If she liked to live in a
room where she could see to do her hair that was no business of
his, and if he couldn&rsquo;t design a plain, simple bedroom that
wasn&rsquo;t going to look ridiculous and make her the
laughing-stock of all the neighbourhood, then the Royal Institute
of British Architects must have strange notions of the sort of
person entitled to go about the country building houses; that if
he thought the proper place for a fire was in a cupboard, she
didn&rsquo;t; that his duty was to carry out the instructions of
his employers, and if he imagined for a moment she was going to
consent to remain shut up in her room till everybody in the house
had finished bathing it would be better for us to secure the
services of somebody possessed of a little commonsense; that next
time she met him she would certainly tell him what she thought of
him, also that she should certainly decline to hold any further
communication with him again; that she doesn&rsquo;t want a
bedroom now of any sort&mdash;perhaps she may be permitted a
shakedown in the pantry, or perhaps Veronica will allow her an
occasional night&rsquo;s rest with her, and if not it
doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to talk to her
yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to say any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that Friday is the St.
Leonards&rsquo; &lsquo;At Home&rsquo; day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
promised Janie that you shall be there in all your best
clothes.&nbsp; (Don&rsquo;t tell her I&rsquo;m calling her
Janie.&nbsp; It might offend her.&nbsp; But nobody calls her Miss
St. Leonard.)&nbsp; Everybody is coming, and all the children are
having their hair washed.&nbsp; You will have it all your own way
down here.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no other celebrity till you get to
Boss Croker, the Tammany man, the other side of Ilsley
Downs.&nbsp; Artists they don&rsquo;t count.&nbsp; The rumour was
all round the place last week that you were here incognito in the
person of a dismal-looking Johnny, staying at the
&lsquo;Fisherman&rsquo;s Retreat,&rsquo; who used to sit all day
in a punt up the backwater drinking whisky.&nbsp; It made me
rather mad when I saw him.&nbsp; I suppose it was the whisky that
suggested the idea to them.&nbsp; They have got the notion in
these parts that a literary man is a sort of inspired
tramp.&nbsp; A Mrs. Jaggerswade&mdash;or some such
name&mdash;whom I met here on Sunday and who is coming on Friday,
took me aside and asked me &lsquo;what sort of things&rsquo; you
said when you talked?&nbsp; She said she felt sure it would be so
clever, and, herself, she was looking forward to it; but would
I&mdash;&lsquo;quite between ourselves&rsquo;&mdash;advise her to
bring the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, you will have to talk seriously to
Veronica.&nbsp; Country life seems to agree with her.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s taken to poaching already&mdash;she and the
twins.&nbsp; It was the one sin that hitherto they had never
committed, and I fancy the old man was feeling proud of
this.&nbsp; Luckily I caught them coming home&mdash;with ten dead
rabbits strung on a pole, the twins carrying it between them on
their shoulders, suggesting the picture of the spies returning
from the promised land with that bunch of grapes&mdash;Veronica
scouting on ahead with, every ten yards, her ear to the ground,
listening for hostile footsteps.&nbsp; The thing that troubled
her most was that she hadn&rsquo;t heard me coming; she seemed to
fear that something had gone wrong with the laws of Nature.&nbsp;
They had found the whole collection hanging from a tree, and had
persuaded themselves that Providence must have been expecting
them.&nbsp; I insisted on their going back with me and showing me
the tree, much to their disgust.&nbsp; And fortunately the keeper
wasn&rsquo;t about&mdash;they are men that love making a
row.&nbsp; I talked some fine moral sentiment to her.&nbsp; But
she says you have told her that it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether
you are good or bad, things happen to you just the same; and this
being so she feels she may as well enjoy herself.&nbsp; I asked
her why she never seemed able to enjoy herself being good&mdash;I
believe if I&rsquo;d always had a kid to bring up I&rsquo;d have
been a model chap myself by this time.&nbsp; Her answer was that
she supposed she was born bad.&nbsp; I pointed out to her that
was a reflection on you and Little Mother; and she answered she
guessed she must be a &lsquo;throw-back.&rsquo;&nbsp; Old
Slee&rsquo;s got a dog that ought to have been a fox-terrier, but
isn&rsquo;t, and he seems to have been explaining things to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thing that will trouble you down here, Dad, is the
cruelty of the country.&nbsp; They catch these poor little
wretches in traps, leaving them sometimes for days suffering what
must be to them nothing short of agony&mdash;to say nothing of
the terror and the hunger.&nbsp; I tried putting my finger in one
of the beastly things and keeping it there for just two minutes
by my watch.&nbsp; It seemed like twenty.&nbsp; The pain grows
more intense with every second, and I&rsquo;m not a soft, as you
know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lain half an hour with a broken leg, and
that wasn&rsquo;t as bad.&nbsp; One hears the little creatures
screaming, but cannot find them.&nbsp; Of course when one draws
near they keep silent.&nbsp; It makes one quite dislike country
people.&nbsp; They are so callous.&nbsp; When you speak to them
about it they only grin.&nbsp; Janie goes nearly mad about
it.&nbsp; Mr. St. Leonard tried to get the clergyman to say
something on the subject, but he answered that he thought it
better &lsquo;for the Church to confine herself to the
accomplishment of her own great mission.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ass!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring Little Mother down; we want to show her off on
Friday.&nbsp; And make her put on something pretty.&nbsp; Ask her
if she&rsquo;s got that lilac thing with lace she wore at
Cambridge for the May Week the year before last.&nbsp; Tell her
not to be silly; it wasn&rsquo;t a bit too young.&nbsp; Nash said
she looked like something out of an old picture, and he&rsquo;s
going to be an artist.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let her dress
herself.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp; And will
you get me a gun&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remainder of the letter was taken up with instructions
concerning the gun.&nbsp; It seemed a complicated sort of
gun.&nbsp; I wished I hadn&rsquo;t read about the gun to
Ethelbertha.&nbsp; It made her nervous for the rest of the
day.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Veronica&rsquo;s letter followed on Thursday morning.&nbsp; I
read it going down in the train.&nbsp; In transcribing I have
thought it better, as regards the spelling, to adopt the more
conventional forms.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will be pleased to hear,&rdquo; Veronica wrote,
&ldquo;that we are all quite well.&nbsp; Robin works very
hard.&nbsp; But I think it does her good.&nbsp; And of course I
help her.&nbsp; All I can.&nbsp; I am glad she has got a
boy.&nbsp; To do the washing-up.&nbsp; I think that was too much
for her.&nbsp; It used to make her cross.&nbsp; One cannot blame
her.&nbsp; It is trying work.&nbsp; And it makes you mucky.&nbsp;
He is a good boy.&nbsp; But has been neglected.&nbsp; So
doesn&rsquo;t know much.&nbsp; I am teaching him grammar.&nbsp;
He says &lsquo;you was&rsquo; and &lsquo;her be.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
is getting better.&nbsp; He says he went to school.&nbsp; But
they couldn&rsquo;t have taken any trouble with him.&nbsp; Could
they?&nbsp; The system, I suppose, was rotten.&nbsp; Robina says
I mustn&rsquo;t overdo it.&nbsp; Because you want him to talk
Berkshire.&nbsp; So I propose confining our attention to the
elementary rules.&nbsp; He had never heard of Robinson
Crusoe.&nbsp; What a life!&nbsp; We went to church on
Sunday.&nbsp; I could not find my gloves.&nbsp; And Robina was
waxy.&nbsp; But Mr. St. Leonard came without his trousers.&nbsp;
Which was worse.&nbsp; We found them in the evening.&nbsp; The
little boy that blew up our stove was there with his
mother.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t speak to her.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
got a doom.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what made him blow it up.&nbsp; He
couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; So you see it wasn&rsquo;t my
fault.&nbsp; After all.&nbsp; His grandfather was blown up.&nbsp;
And he&rsquo;s going to be blown up again.&nbsp; Later on.&nbsp;
But he is very brave.&nbsp; And is going to make a will.&nbsp; I
like all the St. Leonards very much.&nbsp; We went there to tea
on Sunday.&nbsp; And Mr. St. Leonard said I was bright.&nbsp; I
think Miss Janie very beautiful.&nbsp; And so does Dick.&nbsp;
She makes me think of angels.&nbsp; So she does Dick.&nbsp; And
he says she is so kind to her little brothers and sisters.&nbsp;
It is a good sign.&nbsp; I think she ought to marry Dick.&nbsp;
It would steady him.&nbsp; He works very hard.&nbsp; But I think
it does him good.&nbsp; We have breakfast at seven.&nbsp; And I
lay the table.&nbsp; It is very beautiful in the morning.&nbsp;
When you are once up.&nbsp; Mrs. St. Leonard has twins.&nbsp;
They are a great anxiety to her.&nbsp; But she would not part
from them.&nbsp; She has had much trouble.&nbsp; And is sometimes
very sad.&nbsp; I like the girl best.&nbsp; Her name is
Winnie.&nbsp; She is more like a boy.&nbsp; His name is
Wilfrid.&nbsp; But sometimes they change clothes.&nbsp; Then
you&rsquo;re done.&nbsp; They are only nearly seven.&nbsp; But
they know a lot.&nbsp; They are going to teach me swimming.&nbsp;
Is it not kind of them?&nbsp; The two older boys are at home for
their holidays.&nbsp; But they give themselves a lot of
airs.&nbsp; And they called me a flapper.&nbsp; I told him
he&rsquo;d be sorry.&nbsp; When he was a man.&nbsp; Because
perhaps I&rsquo;d grow up beautiful.&nbsp; And then he&rsquo;d
fall in love with me.&nbsp; But he said he wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
So I let him see what I thought of him.&nbsp; The little girl is
very nice.&nbsp; She is about my own age.&nbsp; Her name is
Sally.&nbsp; We are going to write a play.&nbsp; But we
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t let Bertie act in it.&nbsp; Unless he turns
over a new leaf.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to be a princess that
doesn&rsquo;t know it.&nbsp; But only feels it.&nbsp; And
she&rsquo;s going to be a wicked witch.&nbsp; What wants me to
marry her son.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a sight.&nbsp; But I
won&rsquo;t, because I&rsquo;d rather die first.&nbsp; And am in
love with a swineherd.&nbsp; That is a genius.&nbsp; Only nobody
suspects it.&nbsp; I wear a crown in the last act.&nbsp; And
everybody rejoices.&nbsp; Except her.&nbsp; I think it will be
good.&nbsp; We have nearly finished the first act.&nbsp; She
writes very well.&nbsp; And has a sense of atmosphere.&nbsp; And
I tell her what to say.&nbsp; Miss Janie is going to make me a
dress with a train.&nbsp; And gold spangles.&nbsp; And Robina is
going to lend me her blue necklace.&nbsp; Anything will do of
course for the old witch.&nbsp; So it won&rsquo;t be much trouble
to anyone.&nbsp; Mr. Bute is going to paint us some
scenery.&nbsp; And we are going to invite everybody.&nbsp; He is
very nice.&nbsp; Robina says he thinks too much of himself.&nbsp;
By a long chalk.&nbsp; But she is very critical where men are
concerned.&nbsp; She admits it.&nbsp; She says she can&rsquo;t
help it.&nbsp; I find him very affable.&nbsp; And so does
Dick.&nbsp; We think Robina will get over it.&nbsp; And he has
promised not to be angry with her.&nbsp; Because I have told him
that she does not mean it.&nbsp; It is only her way.&nbsp; She
says she feels it is unjust of her.&nbsp; Because really he is
rather charming.&nbsp; I told him that.&nbsp; And he said I was a
dear little girl.&nbsp; He is going to get me a real crown.&nbsp;
Robina says he has nice eyes.&nbsp; I told him that.&nbsp; And he
laughed.&nbsp; There is a gentleman comes here that I think is in
love with Robina.&nbsp; But I shouldn&rsquo;t say anything to her
about it.&nbsp; If I was you.&nbsp; She is very snappy about
it.&nbsp; He is not handsome.&nbsp; But he looks good.&nbsp; He
writes for the papers.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t think he is
rich.&nbsp; And Robina is very nice to him.&nbsp; Until
he&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; Then she gets mad.&nbsp; It all began with
the explosion.&nbsp; So perhaps it was fate.&nbsp; He is going to
keep it out of the papers.&nbsp; As much as he can.&nbsp; But of
course he owes a duty to the public.&nbsp; I am going to decline
to see him.&nbsp; I think it better.&nbsp; Mr. Slee says
everything will be in apple-pie order to-morrow.&nbsp; So you can
come down.&nbsp; And we are going to have Irish stew.&nbsp; And
roly-poly pudding.&nbsp; It will be a change.&nbsp; He is very
nice.&nbsp; And says he was always in trouble himself when he was
a little boy.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all experience.&nbsp; We are all
going on Friday to a party at Mr. St. Leonard&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And
you have got to come too.&nbsp; Robina says I can wear my new
frock.&nbsp; But we can&rsquo;t find the sash.&nbsp; It is very
strange.&nbsp; Because I remember having seen it.&nbsp; You
didn&rsquo;t take it for anything, did you?&nbsp; We shall have
to get a new one, I suppose.&nbsp; It is very annoying.&nbsp; My
new shoes have also not worn well.&nbsp; And they ought to
have.&nbsp; Because Robina says they were expensive.&nbsp; The
donkey has come.&nbsp; And he is sweet.&nbsp; He eats out of my
hand.&nbsp; And lets me kiss him.&nbsp; But he won&rsquo;t
go.&nbsp; He goes a little when you shout at him.&nbsp; Very
loud.&nbsp; Me and Robina went for a drive yesterday after
tea.&nbsp; And Dick ran beside.&nbsp; And shouted.&nbsp; But he
got hoarse.&nbsp; And then he wouldn&rsquo;t go no more.&nbsp;
And Robina did not like it.&nbsp; Because Dick shouted swear
words.&nbsp; He says they come naturally to you when you
shout.&nbsp; And Robina said it was horrible.&nbsp; And that
people would hear him.&nbsp; So we got out.&nbsp; And pushed him
home.&nbsp; But he is very strong.&nbsp; And we were all very
tired.&nbsp; And Robina says she hates him.&nbsp; Dick is going
to give Mr. &rsquo;Opkins half a crown.&nbsp; To tell him how he
makes him go.&nbsp; Because Mr. &rsquo;Opkins makes him
gallop.&nbsp; Robina says it must be hypnotism.&nbsp; But Dick
thinks it might be something simpler.&nbsp; I think Mr.
&rsquo;Opkins very nice.&nbsp; He says you promised to lend him a
book.&nbsp; What would help him to talk like a real country
boy.&nbsp; So I have lent him a book about a window.&nbsp; By Mr.
Bane.&nbsp; What came to see us last year.&nbsp; It has a lot of
funny words in it.&nbsp; And he is going to learn them up.&nbsp;
But he don&rsquo;t know what they mean.&nbsp; No more do I.&nbsp;
I have written a lot of the book.&nbsp; It promises to be very
interesting.&nbsp; It is all a dream.&nbsp; He is just the
ordinary grown-up father.&nbsp; Neither better nor worse.&nbsp;
And he goes up and up.&nbsp; It is a pleasant sensation.&nbsp;
Till he reaches the moon.&nbsp; And there everything is
different.&nbsp; It is the children that know everything.&nbsp;
And are always right.&nbsp; And the grown-ups have to do all what
they tell them.&nbsp; They are kind but firm.&nbsp; It is very
good for him.&nbsp; And when he wakes up he is a better
man.&nbsp; I put down everything that occurs to me.&nbsp; Like
you suggested.&nbsp; There is quite a lot of it.&nbsp; And it
makes you see how unjustly children are treated.&nbsp; They said
I was to feed the donkey.&nbsp; Because it was my donkey.&nbsp;
And I fed him.&nbsp; And there wasn&rsquo;t enough supper for
Dick.&nbsp; And Dick said I was an idiot.&nbsp; And Robina said I
wasn&rsquo;t to feed him.&nbsp; And in the morning there
wasn&rsquo;t anything to feed him on.&nbsp; Because he
won&rsquo;t eat anything but bread-and-butter.&nbsp; And the
baker hadn&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; And he wasn&rsquo;t there.&nbsp;
Because the man that comes to milk the cow had left the door
open.&nbsp; And I was distracted.&nbsp; And Dick asked had I fed
him.&nbsp; And of course I hadn&rsquo;t fed him.&nbsp; And lord
how Dick talked.&nbsp; Never waited to hear anything, mind
you.&nbsp; I let him talk.&nbsp; But it just shows you.&nbsp; We
are all very happy.&nbsp; But shall be pleased to see you.&nbsp;
Once again.&nbsp; The peppermint creams down here are not
good.&nbsp; And are very dear.&nbsp; Compared with London
prices.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t this a good letter?&nbsp; You said I
was to always write just as I thought.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;m doing
it.&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I read selections from this letter aloud to Ethelbertha.&nbsp;
She said she was glad she had decided to come down with me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Had</span> all things gone as ordered, our
arrival at the St. Leonards&rsquo; on Friday afternoon would have
been imposing.&nbsp; It was our entrance, so to speak, upon the
local stage; and Robina had decided it was a case where small
economies ought not to be considered.&nbsp; The livery stable
proprietor had suggested a brougham, but that would have
necessitated one of us riding outside.&nbsp; I explained to
Robina that, in the country, this was usual; and Robina had
replied that much depended upon first impressions.&nbsp; Dick
would, in all probability, claim the place for himself; and, the
moment we were started, stick a pipe in his mouth.&nbsp; She
selected an open landau of quite an extraordinary size, painted
yellow.&nbsp; It looked to me an object more appropriate to a
Lord Mayor&rsquo;s show than to the requirements of a Christian
family; but Robina seemed touchy on the subject, and I said no
more.&nbsp; It certainly was roomy.&nbsp; Old Glossop had turned
it out well, with a pair of greys&mdash;seventeen hands, I judged
them.&nbsp; The only thing that seemed wrong was the
coachman.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t explain why, but he struck me as
the class of youth one associates with a milk-cart.</p>
<p>We set out at a gentle trot.&nbsp; Veronica, who had been in
trouble most of the morning, sat stiffly on the extreme edge of
her seat, clothed in the attitude of one dead to the world; Dick,
in lavender gloves that Robina had thoughtfully bought for him,
next to her.&nbsp; Ethelbertha, Robina, and myself sat perched on
the back seat; to have leaned back would have been to lie
down.&nbsp; Ethelbertha, having made up her mind she was going to
dislike the whole family of the St. Leonards, seemed disinclined
for conversation.&nbsp; Myself I had forgotten my
cigar-case.&nbsp; I have tried the St. Leonard cigar.&nbsp; He
does not smoke himself; but keeps a box for his friends.&nbsp; He
tells me he fancies men are smoking cigars less than
formerly.&nbsp; I did not see how I was going to get a smoke for
the next three hours.&nbsp; Nothing annoys me more than being
bustled and made to forget things.&nbsp; Robina, who has recently
changed her views on the subject of freckles, shared a parasol
with her mother.&nbsp; They had to hold it almost horizontally in
front of them, and this obscured their view.&nbsp; I could not
myself understand why people smiled as we went by.&nbsp; Apart
from the carriage, which they must have seen before, we were not,
I should have said, an exhilarating spectacle.&nbsp; A party of
cyclists laughed outright.&nbsp; Robina said there was one thing
we should have to be careful about, living in the country, and
that was that the strong air and the loneliness combined
didn&rsquo;t sap our intellect.&nbsp; She said she had noticed
it&mdash;the tendency of country people to become prematurely
silly.&nbsp; I did not share her fears, as I had by this time
divined what it was that was amusing folks.&nbsp; Dick had
discovered behind the cushions&mdash;remnant of some recent
wedding, one supposes&mdash;a large and tastefully bound Book of
Common Prayer.&nbsp; He and Veronica sat holding it between
them.&nbsp; Looking at their faces one could almost hear the
organ pealing.</p>
<p>Dick kept one eye on the parasol; and when, on passing into
shade, it was lowered, he and Veronica were watching with rapt
ecstasy the flight of swallows.&nbsp; Robina said she should tell
Mr. Glossop of the insults to which respectable people were
subject when riding in his carriage.&nbsp; She thought he ought
to take steps to prevent it.&nbsp; She likewise suggested that
the four of us, leaving the Little Mother in the carriage, should
walk up the hill.&nbsp; Ethelbertha said that she herself would
like a walk.&nbsp; She had been balancing herself on the edge of
a cushion with her feet dangling for two miles, and was
tired.&nbsp; She herself would have preferred a carriage made for
ordinary-sized people.&nbsp; Our coachman called attention to the
heat of the afternoon and the length of the hill, and recommended
our remaining where we were; but his advice was dismissed as
exhibiting want of feeling.&nbsp; Robina is, perhaps, a trifle
over-sympathetic where animals are concerned.&nbsp; I remember,
when they were children, her banging Dick over the head with the
nursery bellows because he would not agree to talk in a whisper
for fear of waking the cat.&nbsp; You can, of course, overdo
kindness to animals, but it is a fault on the right side; and, as
a rule, I do not discourage her.&nbsp; Veronica was allowed to
remain, owing to her bad knee.&nbsp; It is a most unfortunate
affliction.&nbsp; It comes on quite suddenly.&nbsp; There is
nothing to be seen; but the child&rsquo;s face while she is
suffering from it would move a heart of stone.&nbsp; It had been
troubling her, so it appeared, all the morning; but she had said
nothing, not wishing to alarm her mother.&nbsp; Ethelbertha, who
thinks it may be hereditary&mdash;she herself having had an aunt
who had suffered from contracted ligament&mdash;fixed her up as
comfortably as the pain would permit with cushions in the centre
of the back seat; and the rest of us toiled after the
carriage.</p>
<p>I should not like to say for certain that horses have a sense
of humour, but I sometimes think they must.&nbsp; I had a horse
years ago who used to take delight in teasing girls.&nbsp; I can
describe it no other way.&nbsp; He would pick out a girl a
quarter of a mile off; always some haughty, well-dressed girl who
was feeling pleased with herself.&nbsp; As we approached he would
eye her with horror and astonishment.&nbsp; It was too marked to
escape notice.&nbsp; A hundred yards off he would be walking
sideways, backing away from her; I would see the poor lady
growing scarlet with the insult and annoyance of it.&nbsp;
Opposite to her, he would shy the entire width of the road, and
make pretence to bolt.&nbsp; Looking back I would see her vainly
appealing to surrounding nature for a looking-glass to see what
it was that had gone wrong with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with me,&rdquo; she would be crying
to herself; &ldquo;that the very beasts of the field should shun
me?&nbsp; Do they take me for a gollywog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Halfway up the hill, the off-side grey turned his head and
looked at us.&nbsp; We were about a couple of hundred yards
behind; it was a hot and dusty day.&nbsp; He whispered to the
near-side grey, and the near-side grey turned and looked at us
also.&nbsp; I knew what was coming.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been played
the same trick before.&nbsp; I shouted to the boy, but it was too
late.&nbsp; They took the rest of the hill at a gallop and
disappeared over the brow.&nbsp; Had there been an experienced
coachman behind them, I should not have worried.&nbsp; Dick told
his mother not to be alarmed, and started off at fifteen miles an
hour.&nbsp; I calculated I was doing about ten, which for a
gentleman past his first youth, in a frock suit designed to
disguise rather than give play to the figure, I consider
creditable.&nbsp; Robina, undecided whether to go on ahead with
Dick or remain to assist her mother, wasted vigour by running
from one to the other.&nbsp; Ethelbertha&rsquo;s one hope was
that she might reach the wreckage in time to receive
Veronica&rsquo;s last wishes.</p>
<p>It was in this order that we arrived at the St.
Leonards&rsquo;.&nbsp; Veronica, under an awning, sipping iced
sherbet, appeared to be the centre of the party.&nbsp; She was
recounting her experiences with a modesty that had already won
all hearts.&nbsp; The rest of us, she had explained, had
preferred walking, and would arrive later.&nbsp; She was
evidently pleased to see me, and volunteered the information that
the greys, to all seeming, had enjoyed their gallop.</p>
<p>I sent Dick back to break the good news to his mother.&nbsp;
Young Bute said he would go too.&nbsp; He said he was fresher
than Dick, and would get there first.&nbsp; As a matter of
history he did, and was immediately sorry that he had.</p>
<p>This is not a well-ordered world, or it would not be our good
deeds that would so often get us into trouble.&nbsp;
Robina&rsquo;s insistence on our walking up the hill had been
prompted by tender feeling for dumb animals: a virtuous emotion
that surely the angels should have blessed.&nbsp; The result had
been to bring down upon her suffering and reproach.&nbsp; It is
not often that Ethelbertha loses her temper.&nbsp; When she does
she makes use of the occasion to perform what one might describe
as a mental spring-cleaning.&nbsp; All loose odds and ends of
temper that may be lying about in her mind&mdash;any scrap of
indignation that has been reposing peacefully, half forgotten, in
a corner of her brain, she ferrets out and brushes into the
general heap.&nbsp; Small annoyances of the year before
last&mdash;little things she hadn&rsquo;t noticed at the
time&mdash;incidents in your past life that, so far as you are
concerned, present themselves as dim visions connected maybe with
some previous existence, she whisks triumphantly into her
pan.&nbsp; The method has its advantages.&nbsp; It leaves her,
swept and garnished, without a scrap of ill-feeling towards any
living soul.&nbsp; For quite a long period after one of these
explosions it is impossible to get a cross word out of her.&nbsp;
One has to wait sometimes for months.&nbsp; But while the
clearing up is in progress the atmosphere round about is
disturbing.&nbsp; The element of the whole thing is its
comprehensive swiftness.&nbsp; Before they had reached the summit
of the hill, Robina had acquired a tolerably complete idea of all
she had done wrong since Christmas twelvemonth: the present
afternoon&rsquo;s proceedings&mdash;including as they did the
almost certain sacrificing of a sister to a violent death,
together with the probable destruction of a father, no longer of
an age to trifle with apoplexy&mdash;being but a fit and proper
complement to what had gone before.&nbsp; It would be long, as
Robina herself that evening bitterly declared, before she would
again give ear to the promptings of her better nature.</p>
<p>To take next the sad case of Archibald Bute: his sole desire
had been to relieve, at the earliest moment possible, the
anxieties of a sister and a mother.&nbsp; Robina&rsquo;s new hat,
not intended for sport, had broken away from its
fastenings.&nbsp; With it, it had brought down her hair.&nbsp;
There is a harmless contrivance for building up the female hair
called, I am told, a pad.&nbsp; It can be made of combings, and
then, of course, is literally the girl&rsquo;s own hair.&nbsp; He
came upon Robina at the moment when, retracing her steps and with
her back towards him, she was looking for it.&nbsp; With his
usual luck, he was the first to find it.&nbsp; Ethelbertha
thanked him for his information concerning Veronica, but seemed
chiefly anxious to push on and convince herself that it was
true.&nbsp; She took Dick&rsquo;s arm, and left Robina to follow
on with Bute.</p>
<p>As I explained to him afterwards, had he stopped to ask my
advice I should have counselled his leaving the job to Dick, who,
after all, was only thirty seconds behind him.&nbsp; As regarded
himself, I should have suggested his taking a walk in the
opposite direction, returning, say, in half an hour, and
pretending to have just arrived.&nbsp; By that time Robina, with
the assistance of Janie&rsquo;s brush and comb, and possibly her
powder-puff, would have been feeling herself again.&nbsp; He
could have listened sympathetically to an account of the affair
from Robina herself&mdash;her version, in which she would have
appeared to advantage.&nbsp; Give her time, and she has a sense
of humour.&nbsp; She would have made it bright and
whimsical.&nbsp; Without asserting it in so many words, she would
have conveyed the impression&mdash;I know her way&mdash;that she
alone, throughout the whole commotion, had remained calm and
helpful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear old Dick&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poor dear
papa&rdquo;&mdash;I can hear her saying it&mdash;would have
supplied the low comedy, and Veronica, alluded to with affection
free from sentimentality, would have furnished the dramatic
interest.&nbsp; It is not that Robina intends to mislead, but she
has the artistic instinct.&nbsp; It would have made quite a
charming story; Robina always the central figure.&nbsp; She would
have enjoyed telling it, and would have been pleased with the
person listening.&nbsp; All this&mdash;which would have been the
reward of subterfuge&mdash;he had missed.&nbsp; Virtuous
intention had gained for him nothing but a few scattered
observations from Robina concerning himself; the probable object
of his Creator in fashioning him&mdash;his relation to the scheme
of things in general: observations all of which he had felt to be
unjust.</p>
<p>We compared experiences over a pipe that same evening; and he
told me of a friend of his, a law student, who had shared
diggings with him in Edinburgh.&nbsp; A kinder-hearted young man,
Bute felt sure, could never have breathed; nor one with a
tenderer, more chivalrous regard for women; and the misery this
brought him, to say nothing of the irritation caused to quite a
number of respectable people, could hardly be imagined, so young
Bute assured me, by anyone not personally acquainted with the
parties.&nbsp; It was the plain and snappy girl, and the less
attractive type of old maid, for whom he felt the most
sorrow.&nbsp; He could not help thinking of all they had missed,
and were likely to go on missing; the rapture&mdash;surely the
woman&rsquo;s birthright&mdash;of feeling herself adored, anyhow,
once in her life; the delight of seeing the lover&rsquo;s eye
light up at her coming.&nbsp; Had he been a Mormon he would have
married them all.&nbsp; They too&mdash;the neglected that none
had invited to the feast of love&mdash;they also should know the
joys of home, feel the sweet comfort of a husband&rsquo;s
arm.&nbsp; Being a Christian, his power for good was
limited.&nbsp; But at least he could lift from them the
despairing conviction that they were outside the pale of
masculine affection.&nbsp; Not one of them, so far as he could
help it, but should be able to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;even I had a lover once.&nbsp; No, dear, we
never married.&nbsp; It was one of those spiritual loves; a
formal engagement with a ring would have spoiled
it&mdash;coarsened it.&nbsp; No; it was just a beautiful thing
that came into my life and passed away again, leaving behind it a
fragrance that has sweetened all my days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is how he imagined they would talk about it, years
afterwards, to the little niece or nephew, asking artless
questions&mdash;how they would feel about it themselves.&nbsp;
Whether law circles are peculiarly rich in unattractive
spinsters, or whether it merely happened to be an exceptional
season for them, Bute could not say; but certain it was that the
number of sour-faced girls and fretful old maids in excess of the
demand seemed to be greater than usual that winter in Edinburgh,
with the result that young Hapgood had a busy time of it.&nbsp;
He made love to them, not obtrusively, which might have laid them
open to ridicule&mdash;many of them were old enough to have been
his mother&mdash;but more by insinuation, by subtle
suggestion.&nbsp; His feelings, so they gathered, were too deep
for words; but the adoring eyes with which he would follow their
every movement, the rapt ecstasy with which he would drink in
their lightest remark about the weather, the tone of almost
reverential awe with which he would enquire of them concerning
their lesser ailments&mdash;all conveyed to their sympathetic
observation the message that he dared not tell.&nbsp; He had no
favourites.&nbsp; Sufficient it was that a woman should be
unpleasant, for him to pour out at her feet the simulated passion
of a lifetime.&nbsp; He sent them presents&mdash;nothing
expensive&mdash;wrapped in pleasing pretence of anonymity;
valentines carefully selected for their compromising
character.&nbsp; One carroty-headed old maid with warts he had
kissed upon the brow.</p>
<p>All this he did out of his great pity for them.&nbsp; It was a
beautiful idea, but it worked badly.&nbsp; They did not
understand&mdash;never got the hang of the thing: not one of
them.&nbsp; They thought he was really gone on them.&nbsp; For a
time his elusiveness, his backwardness in coming to the point,
they attributed to a fit and proper fear of his fate; but as the
months went by the feeling of each one was that he was carrying
the apprehension of his own unworthiness too far.&nbsp; They gave
him encouragement, provided for him &ldquo;openings,&rdquo; till
the wonder grew upon them how any woman ever did get
married.&nbsp; At the end of their resources, they consulted
bosom friends.&nbsp; In several instances the bosom friend turned
out to be the bosom friend of more than one of them.&nbsp; The
bosom friends began to take a hand in it.&nbsp; Some of them came
to him with quite a little list, insisting&mdash;playfully at
first&mdash;on his making up his mind what he was going to take
and what he was going to leave; offering, as reward for prompt
decision, to make things as easy for him as possible with the
remainder of the column.</p>
<p>It was then he saw that his good intentions were likely to end
in catastrophe.&nbsp; He would not tell the truth: that the whole
scheme had been conceived out of charity towards all
ill-constructed or dilapidated ladies; that personally he
didn&rsquo;t care a hang for any of them; had only taken them on,
vulgarly speaking, to give them a treat, and because nobody else
would.&nbsp; That wasn&rsquo;t going to be a golden memory,
colouring their otherwise drab existence.&nbsp; He explained that
it was not love&mdash;not the love that alone would justify a
man&rsquo;s asking of a woman that she should give herself to him
for life&mdash;that he felt and always should feel for them, but
merely admiration and deep esteem; and seventeen of them thought
that would be sufficient to start with, and offered to chance the
rest.</p>
<p>The truth had to come out.&nbsp; Friends who knew his noble
nature could not sit by and hear him denounced as a heartless and
eccentric profligate.&nbsp; Ladies whose beauty and popularity
were beyond dispute thought it a touching and tender thing for
him to have done; but every woman to whom he had ever addressed a
kind word wanted to wring his neck.</p>
<p>He did the most sensible thing he could, under all the
circumstances; changed his address to Aberdeen, where he had an
aunt living.&nbsp; But the story followed him.&nbsp; No woman
would be seen speaking to him.&nbsp; One admiring glance from
Hapgood would send the prettiest girls home weeping to their
mothers.&nbsp; Later on he fell in love&mdash;hopelessly, madly
in love.&nbsp; But he dared not tell her&mdash;dared not let a
living soul guess it.&nbsp; That was the only way he could show
it.&nbsp; It is not sufficient, in this world, to want to do
good; there&rsquo;s got to be a knack about it.</p>
<p>There was a man I met in Colorado, one Christmas-time.&nbsp; I
was on a lecturing tour.&nbsp; His idea was to send a loving
greeting to his wife in New York.&nbsp; He had been married
nineteen years, and this was the first time he had been separated
from his family on Christmas Day.&nbsp; He pictured them round
the table in the little far-away New England parlour; his wife,
his sister-in-law, Uncle Silas, Cousin Jane, Jack and Willy, and
golden-haired Lena.&nbsp; They would be just sitting down to
dinner, talking about him, most likely; wishing he were among
them.&nbsp; They were a nice family and all fond of him.&nbsp;
What joy it would give them to know that he was safe and sound;
to hear the very tones of his loved voice speaking to them!&nbsp;
Modern science has made possible these miracles.&nbsp; True, the
long-distance telephone would cost him five dollars; but what is
five dollars weighed against the privilege of wafting happiness
to an entire family on Christmas Day!&nbsp; We had just come back
from a walk.&nbsp; He slammed the money down, and laughed aloud
at the thought of the surprise he was about to give them all.</p>
<p>The telephone bell rang out clear and distinct at the precise
moment when his wife, with knife and fork in hand, was preparing
to carve the turkey.&nbsp; She was a nervous lady, and twice that
week had dreamed that she had seen her husband without being able
to get to him.&nbsp; On the first occasion she had seen him enter
a dry-goods store in Broadway, and hastening across the road had
followed him in.&nbsp; He was hardly a dozen yards in front of
her, but before she could overtake him all the young lady
assistants had rushed from behind their counters and, forming a
circle round her, had refused to let her pass, which in her dream
had irritated her considerably.&nbsp; On the next occasion he had
boarded a Brooklyn car in which she was returning home.&nbsp; She
had tried to attract his attention with her umbrella, but he did
not seem to see her; and every time she rose to go across to him
the car gave a jerk and bumped her back into her seat.&nbsp; When
she did get over to him it was not her husband at all, but the
gentleman out of the Quaker Oats advertisement.&nbsp; She went to
the telephone, feeling&mdash;as she said herself
afterwards&mdash;all of a tremble.</p>
<p>That you could speak from Colorado to New York she would not
then have believed had you told her.&nbsp; The thing was in its
early stages, which may also have accounted for the voice
reaching her strange and broken.&nbsp; I was standing beside him
while he spoke.&nbsp; We were in the vestibule of the Savoy Hotel
at Colorado Springs.&nbsp; It was five o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon, which would be about seven in New York.&nbsp; He told
her he was safe and well, and that she was not to fret about
him.&nbsp; He told her he had been that morning for a walk in the
Garden of the Gods, which is the name given to the local park;
they do that sort of thing in Colorado.&nbsp; Also that he had
drunk from the silicial springs abounding in that favoured
land.&nbsp; I am not sure that &ldquo;silicial&rdquo; was the
correct word.&nbsp; He was not sure himself: added to which he
pronounced it badly.&nbsp; Whatever they were, he assured her
they had done him good.&nbsp; He sent a special message to his
Cousin Jane&mdash;a maiden lady of means&mdash;to the effect that
she could rely upon seeing him soon.&nbsp; She was a touchy old
lady, and liked to be singled out for special attention.&nbsp; He
made the usual kind enquiries about everybody, sent them all his
blessing, and only wished they could be with him in this
delectable land where it seemed to be always sunshine and balmy
breezes.&nbsp; He could have said more, but his time being up the
telephone people switched him off; and feeling he had done a good
and thoughtful deed, he suggested a game of billiards.</p>
<p>Could he have been a witness of events at the other end of the
wire, his condition would have been one of less
self-complacence.&nbsp; Long before the end of the first sentence
his wife had come to the conclusion that this was a message from
the dead.&nbsp; Why through a telephone did not greatly worry
her.&nbsp; It seemed as reasonable a medium as any other she had
ever heard of&mdash;indeed a trifle more so.&nbsp; Later, when
she was able to review the matter calmly, it afforded her some
consolation to reflect that things might have been worse.&nbsp;
That &ldquo;garden,&rdquo; together with the &ldquo;silicial
springs&rdquo;&mdash;which she took to be
&ldquo;celestial,&rdquo; there was not much difference the way he
pronounced it&mdash;was distinctly reassuring.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;eternal sunshine&rdquo; and the &ldquo;balmy
breezes&rdquo; likewise agreed with her knowledge of heavenly
topography as derived from the Congregational Hymn-Book.&nbsp;
That he should have needed to enquire concerning the health of
herself and the children had puzzled her.&nbsp; The only
explanation was that they didn&rsquo;t know everything, not even
up.&nbsp; There&mdash;may be, not the new-comers.&nbsp; She had
answered as coherently as her state of distraction would permit,
and had then dropped limply to the floor.&nbsp; It was the sound
of her falling against the umbrella-stand and upsetting it that
brought them all trooping out from the dining-room.</p>
<p>It took her some time to get the thing home to them; and when
she had finished, her brother Silas, acting on the impulse of the
moment, rang up the Exchange, with some vague idea of getting
into communication with St. Peter and obtaining further
particulars, but recollected himself in time to explain to the
&ldquo;hulloa girl&rdquo; that he had made a mistake.</p>
<p>The eldest boy, a practical youth, pointed out, very sensibly,
that nothing could be gained by their not going on with their
dinner, but was bitterly reproached for being able to think of
any form of enjoyment at a moment when his poor dear father was
in heaven.&nbsp; It reminded his mother of the special message to
Cousin Jane, who up to that moment had been playing the part of
comforter.&nbsp; With the collapse of Cousin Jane, dramatic in
its suddenness, conversation disappeared.&nbsp; At nine
o&rsquo;clock the entire family went dinnerless to bed.</p>
<p>The eldest boy&mdash;as I have said, a practical
youth&mdash;had the sense to get up early the next morning and
send a wire, which brought the glad news back to them that their
beloved one was not in heaven, but was still in Colorado.&nbsp;
But the only reward my friend got for all his tender
thoughtfulness was the vehement injunction never for the
remainder of his life to play such a fool&rsquo;s trick
again.</p>
<p>There were other cases I could have recited showing the ill
recompense that so often overtakes the virtuous action; but, as I
explained to Bute, it would have saddened me to dwell upon the
theme.</p>
<p>It was quite a large party assembled at the St.
Leonards&rsquo;, including one or two county people, and I should
have liked, myself, to have made a better entrance.&nbsp; A large
lady with a very small voice seemed to be under the impression
that I had arranged the whole business on purpose.&nbsp; She said
it was &ldquo;so dramatic.&rdquo;&nbsp; One good thing came out
of it: Janie, in her quiet, quick way, saw to it that Ethelbertha
and Robina slipped into the house unnoticed by way of the
dairy.&nbsp; When they joined the other guests, half an hour
later, they had had a cup of tea and a rest, and were feeling
calm and cool, with their hair nicely done; and Ethelbertha
remarked to Robina on the way home what a comfort it must be to
Mrs. St. Leonard to have a daughter so capable, one who knew just
the right thing to do, and did it without making a fuss and a
disturbance.</p>
<p>Everyone was very nice.&nbsp; Of course we made the usual
mistake: they talked to me about books and plays, and I gave them
my views on agriculture and cub-hunting.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
quite sure what fool it was who described a bore as a man who
talked about himself.&nbsp; As a matter of fact it is the only
subject the average man knows sufficiently well to make
interesting.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a man I know; he makes a fortune
out of a patent food for infants.&nbsp; He began life as a dairy
farmer, and hit upon it quite by accident.&nbsp; When he talks
about the humours of company promoting and the tricks of the
advertising agent he is amusing.&nbsp; I have sat at his table,
when he was a bachelor, and listened to him by the hour with
enjoyment.&nbsp; The mistake he made was marrying a broad-minded,
cultured woman, who ruined him&mdash;conversationally, I
mean.&nbsp; He is now well-informed and tiresome on most
topics.&nbsp; That is why actors and actresses are always such
delightful company: they are not ashamed to talk about
themselves.&nbsp; I remember a dinner-party once: our host was
one of the best-known barristers in London.&nbsp; A famous lady
novelist sat on his right, and a scientist of world-wide
reputation had the place of honour next our hostess, who herself
had written a history of the struggle for nationality in South
America that serves as an authority to all the Foreign Offices in
Europe.&nbsp; Among the remaining guests were a bishop, the
editor-in-chief of a London daily newspaper, a man who knew the
interior of China as well as most men know their own club, a
Russian revolutionist just escaped from Siberia, a leading
dramatist, a Cabinet Minister, and a poet whose name is a
household word wherever the English tongue is spoken.&nbsp; And
for two hours we sat and listened to a wicked-looking little
woman who from the boards of a Bowery music-hall had worked her
way up to the position of a star in musical comedy.&nbsp;
Education, as she observed herself without regret, had not been
compulsory throughout the waterside district of Chicago in her
young days; and, compelled to earn her own living from the age of
thirteen, opportunity for supplying the original deficiency had
been wanting.&nbsp; But she knew her subject, which was
Herself&mdash;her experiences, her reminiscences: and bad sense
enough to stick to it.&nbsp; Until the moment when she took
&ldquo;the liberty of chipping in,&rdquo; to use her own
expression, the amount of twaddle talked had been
appalling.&nbsp; The bishop had told us all he had learnt about
China during a visit to San Francisco, while the man who had
spent the last twenty years of his life in the country was busy
explaining his views on the subject of the English drama.&nbsp;
Our hostess had been endeavouring to make the scientist feel at
home by talking to him about radium.&nbsp; The dramatist had
explained at some length his views of the crisis in Russia.&nbsp;
The poet had quite spoilt his dinner trying to suggest to the
Cabinet Minister new sources of taxation.&nbsp; The Russian
revolutionist had told us what ought to have been a funny story
about a duck; and the lady novelist and the Cabinet Minister had
discussed Christian Science for a quarter of an hour, each under
the mistaken impression that the other one was a believer in
it.&nbsp; The editor had been explaining the attitude of the
Church towards the New Theology; and our host, one of the
wittiest men at the Bar, had been talking chiefly to the
butler.&nbsp; The relief of listening to anybody talking about
something they knew was like finding a match-box to a man who has
been barking his shins in the dark.&nbsp; For the rest of the
dinner we clung to her.</p>
<p>I could have made myself quite interesting to these good
squires and farmers talking to them about theatres and the
literary celebrities I have met; and they could have told me dog
stories and given me useful information as to the working of the
Small Holdings Act.&nbsp; They said some very charming things
about my books&mdash;mostly to the effect that they read and
enjoyed them when feeling ill or suffering from mental
collapse.&nbsp; I gathered that had they always continued in a
healthy state of mind and body it would not have occurred to them
to read me.&nbsp; One man assured me I had saved his life.&nbsp;
It was his brain, he told me.&nbsp; He had been so upset by
something that had happened to him that he had almost lost his
reason.&nbsp; There were times when he could not even remember
his own name; his mind seemed an absolute blank.&nbsp; And then
one day by chance&mdash;or Providence, or whatever you choose to
call it&mdash;he had taken up a book of mine.&nbsp; It was the
only thing he had been able to read for months and months!&nbsp;
And now, whenever he felt himself run down&mdash;his brain like a
squeezed orange (that was his simile)&mdash;he would put
everything else aside and read a book of mine&mdash;any one: it
didn&rsquo;t matter which.&nbsp; I suppose one ought to be glad
that one has saved somebody&rsquo;s life; but I should like to
have the choosing of them myself.</p>
<p>I am not sure that Ethelbertha is going to like Mrs. St.
Leonard; and I don&rsquo;t think Mrs. St. Leonard will much like
Ethelbertha.&nbsp; I have gathered that Mrs. St. Leonard
doesn&rsquo;t like anybody much&mdash;except, of course, when it
is her duty.&nbsp; She does not seem to have the time.&nbsp; Man
is born to trouble, and it is not bad philosophy to get oneself
accustomed to the feeling.&nbsp; But Mrs. St. Leonard has given
herself up to the pursuit of trouble to the exclusion of all
other interests in life.&nbsp; She appears to regard it as the
only calling worthy a Christian woman.&nbsp; I found her alone
one afternoon.&nbsp; Her manner was preoccupied; I asked if I
could be of any assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I am merely trying to
think what it can be that has been worrying me all the
morning.&nbsp; It has clean gone out of my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remembered it a little later with a glad sigh.</p>
<p>St. Leonard himself, Ethelbertha thinks charming.&nbsp; We are
to go again on Sunday for her to see the children.&nbsp; Three or
four people we met I fancy we shall be able to fit in with.&nbsp;
We left at half-past six, and took Bute back with us to
supper.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">She&rsquo;s</span> a good
woman,&rdquo; said Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a good woman?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying, I expect; although he is an old
dear: to live with, I mean,&rdquo; continued Robina, addressing
apparently the rising moon.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then there are all
those children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are thinking of Mrs. St. Leonard,&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems no way of making her happy,&rdquo;
explained Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;On Thursday I went round early in
the morning to help Janie pack the baskets for the picnic.&nbsp;
It was her own idea, the picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of picnics,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have thought,&rdquo; went on Robina,
&ldquo;that she was dressing for her own funeral.&nbsp; She said
she knew she was going to catch her death of cold, sitting on the
wet grass.&nbsp; Something told her.&nbsp; I reminded her it
hadn&rsquo;t rained for three weeks, and that everything was as
dry as a bone, but she said that made no difference to
grass.&nbsp; There is always a moisture in grass, and that
cushions and all that only helped to draw it out.&nbsp; Not that
it mattered.&nbsp; The end had to come, and so long as the others
were happy&mdash;you know her style.&nbsp; Nobody ever thought of
her.&nbsp; She was to be dragged here, dragged there.&nbsp; She
talked about herself as if she were some sacred image.&nbsp; It
got upon my nerves at last, so that I persuaded Janie to let me
offer to stop at home with her.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t too keen
about going myself; not by that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When our desires leave us, says Rochefoucauld,&rdquo; I
remarked, &ldquo;we pride ourselves upon our virtue in having
overcome them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was her fault, anyhow,&rdquo; retorted Robina;
&ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t make a virtue of it.&nbsp; I told her
I&rsquo;d just as soon not go, and that I felt sure the others
would be all right without her, so that there was no need for her
to be dragged anywhere.&nbsp; And then she burst into
tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;that it was hard
on her to have children who could wish to go to a picnic and
leave their mother at home; that it was little enough enjoyment
she had in her life, heaven knows; that if there was one thing
she had been looking forward to it was this day&rsquo;s outing;
but still, of course, if everybody would be happier without
her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of the sort,&rdquo; admitted Robina;
&ldquo;only there was a lot of it.&nbsp; We had to all fuss round
her, and swear that without her it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth
calling a picnic.&nbsp; She brightened up on the way
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The screech-owl in the yew-tree emitted a blood-curdling
scream.&nbsp; He perches there each evening on the extreme end of
the longest bough.&nbsp; Dimly outlined against the night, he has
the appearance of a friendly hobgoblin.&nbsp; But I wish he
didn&rsquo;t fancy himself as a vocalist.&nbsp; It is against his
own interests, I am sure, if he only knew it.&nbsp; That American
college yell of his must have the effect of sending every living
thing within half a mile back into its hole.&nbsp; Maybe it is a
provision of nature for clearing off the very old mice who have
become stone deaf and would otherwise be a burden on their
relatives.&nbsp; The others, unless out for suicide, must, one
thinks, be tolerably safe.&nbsp; Ethelbertha is persuaded he is a
sign of death; but seeing there isn&rsquo;t a square quarter of a
mile in this county without its screech-owl, there can hardly by
this time be a resident that an Assurance Society would look
at.&nbsp; Veronica likes him.&nbsp; She even likes his
screech.&nbsp; I found her under the tree the other night,
wrapped up in a shawl, trying to learn it.&nbsp; As if one of
them were not enough!&nbsp; It made me quite cross with
her.&nbsp; Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t a bit like it, as I told
her.&nbsp; She said it was better than I could do, anyhow; and I
was idiot enough to take up the challenge.&nbsp; It makes me
angry now, when I think of it: a respectable, middle-aged
literary man, standing under a yew-tree trying to screech like an
owl.&nbsp; And the bird was silly enough to encourage us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a charming girl,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;seven-and-twenty years ago, when St. Leonard fell in love
with her.&nbsp; She had those dark, dreamy eyes so suggestive of
veiled mysteries; and her lips must have looked bewitching when
they pouted.&nbsp; I expect they often did.&nbsp; They do so
still; but the pout of a woman of forty-six no longer
fascinates.&nbsp; To a pretty girl of nineteen a spice of temper,
an illogical unreasonableness, are added attractions: the scratch
of a blue-eyed kitten only tempts us to tease her the more.&nbsp;
Young Hubert St. Leonard&mdash;he had curly brown hair, with a
pretty trick of blushing, and was going to conquer the
world&mdash;found her fretfulness, her very selfishness adorable:
and told her so, kneeling before her, gazing into her bewildering
eyes&mdash;only he called it her waywardness, her imperiousness;
begged her for his sake to be more capricious.&nbsp; Told her how
beautiful she looked when displeased.&nbsp; So, no doubt, she
did&mdash;at nineteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell you all that, did he?&rdquo;
demanded Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; I reassured her, &ldquo;except that
she was acknowledged by all authorities to have been the most
beautiful girl in Tunbridge Wells, and that her father had been
ruined by a rascally solicitor.&nbsp; No, I was merely, to use
the phrase of the French police courts, &lsquo;reconstructing the
crime.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be all wrong,&rdquo; grumbled Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why?&nbsp;
Does it strike you as improbable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were sitting in the porch, waiting for Dick to come by the
white path across the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;It all sounds
very probable.&nbsp; I wish it didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;that I am
an old playgoer.&nbsp; I have sat out so many of this
world&rsquo;s dramas.&nbsp; It is as easy to reconstruct them
backwards as forwards.&nbsp; We are witnessing the last act of
the St. Leonard drama: that unsatisfactory last act that merely
fills out time after the play is ended!&nbsp; The intermediate
acts were probably more exciting, containing &lsquo;passionate
scenes&rsquo; played with much earnestness; chiefly for the
amusement of the servants.&nbsp; But the first act, with the
Kentish lanes and woods for a back-cloth, must have been
charming.&nbsp; Here was the devout lover she had heard of,
dreamed of.&nbsp; It is delightful to be regarded as
perfection&mdash;not absolute perfection, for that might put a
strain upon us to live up to, but as so near perfection that to
be more perfect would just spoil it.&nbsp; The spots upon us,
that unappreciative friends and relations would magnify into
blemishes, seen in their true light: artistic shading relieving a
faultlessness that might otherwise prove too glaring.&nbsp; Dear
Hubert found her excellent just as she was in every detail.&nbsp;
It would have been a crime against Love for her to seek to change
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, it was his fault,&rdquo; argued
Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he was silly enough to like her faults,
and encourage her in them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could he have done,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;even if
he had seen them?&nbsp; A lover does not point out his
mistress&rsquo;s shortcomings to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much the more sensible plan if he did,&rdquo; insisted
Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then if she cared for him she could set to
work to cure herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would like it?&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;you would
appreciate it in your own case?&nbsp; Can you imagine young
Bute&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why young Bute?&rdquo; demanded Robina;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s he got to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;except that he
happens to be the first male creature you have ever come across
since you were six that you haven&rsquo;t flirted
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t flirt with them,&rdquo; said Robina;
&ldquo;I merely try to be nice to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the exception of young Bute,&rdquo; I
persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He irritates me,&rdquo; Robina explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was reading,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the other day, an
account of the marriage customs prevailing among the Lower
Caucasians.&nbsp; The lover takes his stand beneath his
lady&rsquo;s window, and, having attracted her attention,
proceeds to sing.&nbsp; And if she seems to like it&mdash;if she
listens to it without getting mad, that means she doesn&rsquo;t
want him.&nbsp; But if she gets upset about it&mdash;slams down
the window and walks away, then it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; I
think it&rsquo;s the Lower Caucasians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a very silly people,&rdquo; said Robina;
&ldquo;I suppose a pail of water would be the highest proof of
her affection he could hope for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A complex being, man,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
will call him X.&nbsp; Can you imagine young X coming to you and
saying: &lsquo;My dear Robina, you have many excellent
qualities.&nbsp; You can be amiable&mdash;so long as you are
having your own way in everything; but thwarted you can be just
horrid.&nbsp; You are very kind&mdash;to those who are willing
for you to be kind to them in your own way, which is not always
their way.&nbsp; You can be quite unselfish&mdash;when you happen
to be in an unselfish mood, which is far from frequent.&nbsp; You
are capable and clever, but, like most capable and clever people,
impatient and domineering; highly energetic when not feeling
lazy; ready to forgive the moment your temper is exhausted.&nbsp;
You are generous and frank, but if your object could only be
gained through meanness or deceit you would not hesitate a moment
longer than was necessary to convince yourself that the
circumstances justified the means.&nbsp; You are sympathetic,
tender-hearted, and have a fine sense of justice; but I can see
that tongue of yours, if not carefully watched, wearing decidedly
shrewish.&nbsp; You have any amount of grit.&nbsp; A man might go
tiger-hunting with you&mdash;with no one better; but you are
obstinate, conceited, and exacting.&nbsp; In short, to sum you
up, you have all the makings in you of an ideal wife combined
with faults sufficient to make a Socrates regret he&rsquo;d ever
married you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would!&rdquo; said Robina, springing to her
feet.&nbsp; I could not see her face, but I knew there was the
look upon it that made Primgate want to paint her as Joan of Arc;
only it would never stop long enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love
him for talking like that.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;d respect him.&nbsp;
If he was that sort of man I&rsquo;d pray God to help me to be
the sort of woman he wanted me to be.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d try.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d try all day long.&nbsp; I would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; Robina had surprised
me.&nbsp; I admit it.&nbsp; I thought I knew the sex better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any girl would,&rdquo; said Robina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a new idea,&rdquo; I mused.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Gott im Himmel</i>! what a new world might it not
create!&rdquo;&nbsp; The fancy began to take hold of me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Love no longer blind.&nbsp; Love refusing any more to be
the poor blind fool&mdash;sport of gods and men.&nbsp; Love no
longer passion&rsquo;s slave.&nbsp; His bonds broken, the
senseless bandage flung aside.&nbsp; Love helping life instead of
muddling it.&nbsp; Marriage, the foundation of civilisation, no
longer reared upon the sands of lies and illusions, but grappled
to the rock of truth&mdash;reality.&nbsp; Have you ever read
&lsquo;Tom Jones?&rsquo;&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Robina; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
heard it wasn&rsquo;t a nice book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man
isn&rsquo;t a nice animal, not all of him.&nbsp; Nor woman
either.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a deal of the beast in man.&nbsp;
What can you expect?&nbsp; Till a few paltry thousands of years
ago he <i>was</i> a beast, fighting with other beasts, his fellow
denizens of the woods and caves; watching for his prey, crouched
in the long grass of the river&rsquo;s bank, tearing it with
claws and teeth, growling as he ate.&nbsp; So he lived and died
through the dim unnamed ages, transmitting his beast&rsquo;s
blood, his bestial instincts, to his offspring, growing ever
stronger, fiercer, from generation to generation, while the rocks
piled up their strata and the oceans shaped their beds.&nbsp;
Moses!&nbsp; Why, Lord Rothschild&rsquo;s great-grandfather, a
few score times removed, must have known Moses, talked with
him.&nbsp; Babylon!&nbsp; It is a modern city, fallen into disuse
for the moment, owing to alteration of traffic routes.&nbsp;
History! it is a tale of to-day.&nbsp; Man was crawling about the
world on all fours, learning to be an animal for millions of
years before the secret of his birth was whispered to him.&nbsp;
It is only during the last few centuries that he has been trying
to be a man.&nbsp; Our modern morality!&nbsp; Why, compared with
the teachings of nature, it is but a few days old.&nbsp; What do
you expect?&nbsp; That he shall forget the lessons of the
&aelig;ons at the bidding of the hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you advise me to read &lsquo;Tom
Jones&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I do.&nbsp; I should not if
I thought you were still a child, knowing only blind trust, or
blind terror.&nbsp; The sun is not extinguished because
occasionally obscured by mist; the scent of the rose is not dead
because of the worm in the leaf.&nbsp; A healthy rose can afford
a few worms&mdash;has got to, anyhow.&nbsp; All men are not Tom
Joneses.&nbsp; The standard of masculine behaviour continues to
go up: many of us make fine efforts to conform to it, and some of
us succeed.&nbsp; But the Tom Jones is there in all of us who are
not an&aelig;mic or consumptive.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s no sense
at all in getting cross with us about it, because we cannot help
it.&nbsp; We are doing our best.&nbsp; In another hundred
thousand years or so, provided all goes well, we shall be the
perfect man.&nbsp; And seeing our early training, I flatter
myself that, up to the present, we have done remarkably
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like being satisfied with oneself,&rdquo; said
Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not satisfied,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only hopeful.&nbsp; But it irritates me when I
hear people talk as though man had been born a white-souled angel
and was making supernatural efforts to become a sinner.&nbsp;
That seems to me the way to discourage him.&nbsp; What he wants
is bucking up; somebody to say to him, &lsquo;Bravo! why, this is
splendid!&nbsp; Just think, my boy, what you were, and that not
so very long ago&mdash;an unwashed, hairy savage; your law that
of the jungle, your morals those of the rabbit-warren.&nbsp; Now
look at yourself&mdash;dressed in your little shiny hat, your
trousers neatly creased, walking with your wife to church on
Sunday!&nbsp; Keep on&mdash;that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to
do.&nbsp; In a few more centuries your own mother Nature
won&rsquo;t know you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You women,&rdquo; I continued; &ldquo;why, a handful of
years ago we bought and sold you, kept you in cages, took the
stick to you when you were not spry in doing what you were
told.&nbsp; Did you ever read the history of Patient
Griselda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Robina, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
gathered from her tone that the Joan of Arc expression had
departed.&nbsp; Had Primgate wanted to paint her at that
particular moment I should have suggested Katherine&mdash;during
the earlier stages&mdash;listening to a curtain lecture from
Petruchio.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you suggesting that all women should
take her for a model?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; Though
were we living in Chaucer&rsquo;s time I might; and you would not
think it even silly.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;m impressing upon you is
that the human race has yet a little way to travel before the
average man can be regarded as an up-to-date edition of King
Arthur&mdash;the King Arthur of the poetical legend, I
mean.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be too impatient with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking what a beast he has been ought to make him
impatient himself with himself,&rdquo; considered Robina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He ought to be feeling so ashamed of himself as to be
willing to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owl in the old yew screamed, whether with indignation or
amusement I cannot tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And woman,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;had the power been
hers, would she have used it to sweeter purpose?&nbsp; Where is
your evidence?&nbsp; Your Cleopatras, Pompadours, Jezebels; your
Catherines of Russia, late Empresses of China; your Faustines of
all ages and all climes; your Mother Brownriggs; your Lucretia
Borgias, Salomes&mdash;I could weary you with names.&nbsp; Your
Roman task-mistresses; your drivers of lodging-house slaveys;
your ladies who whipped their pages to death in the Middle Ages;
your modern dames of fashion, decked with the plumage of the
tortured grove.&nbsp; There have been other women
also&mdash;noble women, their names like beacon-lights studding
the dark waste of history.&nbsp; So there have been noble
men&mdash;saints, martyrs, heroes.&nbsp; The sex-line divides us
physically, not morally.&nbsp; Woman has been man&rsquo;s
accomplice in too many crimes to claim to be his judge.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Male and female created He them&rsquo;&mdash;like and
like, for good and evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By good fortune I found a loose match.&nbsp; I lighted a fresh
cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, I suppose, is the average man,&rdquo; said
Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of us are,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when we are at
home.&nbsp; Carlyle was the average man in the little front
parlour in Cheyne Row, though, to hear fools talk, you might
think no married couple outside literary circles had ever been
known to exchange a cross look.&nbsp; So was Oliver Cromwell in
his own palace with the door shut.&nbsp; Mrs. Cromwell must have
thought him monstrous silly, placing sticky sweetmeats for his
guests to sit on&mdash;told him so, most likely.&nbsp; A cheery,
kindly man, notwithstanding, though given to moods.&nbsp; He and
Mrs. Cromwell seem to have rubbed along, on the whole, pretty
well together.&nbsp; Old Sam Johnson&mdash;great, God-fearing,
lovable, cantankerous old brute!&nbsp; Life with him, in a small
house on a limited income, must have had its ups and downs.&nbsp;
Milton and Frederick the Great were, one hopes, a little below
the average.&nbsp; Did their best, no doubt; lacked
understanding.&nbsp; Not so easy as it looks, living up to the
standard of the average man.&nbsp; Very clever people, in
particular, find it tiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never marry,&rdquo; said Robina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At least, I hope I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why &lsquo;hope&rsquo;?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I hope I shall never be idiot enough,&rdquo;
she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see it all so clearly.&nbsp; I wish
I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Love! it&rsquo;s only an ugly thing with a
pretty name.&nbsp; It will not be me that he will fall in love
with.&nbsp; He will not know me until it is too late.&nbsp; How
can he?&nbsp; It will be merely with the outside of me&mdash;my
pink-and-white skin, my rounded arms.&nbsp; I feel it sometimes
when I see men looking at me, and it makes me mad.&nbsp; And at
other times the admiration in their eyes pleases me.&nbsp; And
that makes me madder still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon had slipped behind the wood.&nbsp; She had risen,
and, leaning against the porch, was standing with her hands
clasped.&nbsp; I fancy she had forgotten me.&nbsp; She seemed to
be talking to the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a trick of Nature to make fools of
us,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will tell me I am all the
world to him; that his love will outlive the stars&mdash;will
believe it himself at the time, poor fellow!&nbsp; He will call
me a hundred pretty names, will kiss my feet and hands.&nbsp; And
if I&rsquo;m fool enough to listen to him, it may
last&rdquo;&mdash;she laughed; it was rather an ugly
laugh&mdash;&ldquo;six months; with luck perhaps a year, if
I&rsquo;m careful not to go out in the east wind and come home
with a red nose, and never let him catch me in curl papers.&nbsp;
It will not be me that he will want: only my youth, and the
novelty of me, and the mystery.&nbsp; And when that is
gone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to me.&nbsp; It was a strange face I saw then in
the pale light, quite a fierce little face.&nbsp; She laid her
hands upon my shoulders, and I felt them cold.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
comes when it is dead?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
follows?&nbsp; You must know.&nbsp; Tell me.&nbsp; I want the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her vehemence had arisen so suddenly.&nbsp; The little girl I
had set out to talk with was no longer there.&nbsp; To my
bewilderment, it was a woman that was questioning me.</p>
<p>I drew her down beside me.&nbsp; But the childish face was
still stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the truth,&rdquo; she said; so that I answered
very gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the passion is passed; when the glory and the
wonder of Desire&mdash;Nature&rsquo;s eternal ritual of marriage,
solemnising, sanctifying it to her commands&mdash;is ended; when,
sooner or later, some grey dawn finds you wandering bewildered in
once familiar places, seeking vainly the lost palace of
youth&rsquo;s dreams; when Love&rsquo;s frenzy is faded, like the
fragrance of the blossom, like the splendour of the dawn; there
will remain to you, just what was there before&mdash;no more, no
less.&nbsp; If passion was all you had to give to one another,
God help you.&nbsp; You have had your hour of madness.&nbsp; It
is finished.&nbsp; If greed of praise and worship was your
price&mdash;well, you have had your payment.&nbsp; The bargain is
complete.&nbsp; If mere hope to be made happy was your lure, one
pities you.&nbsp; We do not make each other happy.&nbsp;
Happiness is the gift of the gods, not of man.&nbsp; The secret
lies within you, not without.&nbsp; What remains to you will
depend not upon what you <i>thought</i>, but upon what you
<i>are</i>.&nbsp; If behind the lover there was the
man&mdash;behind the impossible goddess of his love-sick brain
some honest, human woman, then life lies not behind you, but
before you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is giving, not getting.&nbsp; That is the mistake
we most of us set out with.&nbsp; It is the work that is the joy,
not the wages; the game, not the score.&nbsp; The lover&rsquo;s
delight is to yield, not to claim.&nbsp; The crown of motherhood
is pain.&nbsp; To serve the State at cost of ease and leisure; to
spend his thought and labour upon a hundred schemes, is the
man&rsquo;s ambition.&nbsp; Life is doing, not having.&nbsp; It
is to gain the peak the climber strives, not to possess it.&nbsp;
Fools marry thinking what they are going to get out of it: good
store of joys and pleasure, opportunities for self-indulgence,
eternal soft caresses&mdash;the wages of the wanton.&nbsp; The
rewards of marriage are toil, duty, responsibility&mdash;manhood,
womanhood.&nbsp; Love&rsquo;s baby talk you will have
outgrown.&nbsp; You will no longer be his &lsquo;Goddess,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Angel,&rsquo; &lsquo;Popsy Wopsy,&rsquo; &lsquo;Queen of
his heart.&rsquo;&nbsp; There are finer names than these: wife,
mother, priestess in the temple of humanity.&nbsp; Marriage is
renunciation, the sacrifice of Self upon the altar of the
race.&nbsp; &lsquo;A trick of Nature&rsquo; you call it.&nbsp;
Perhaps.&nbsp; But a trick of Nature compelling you to surrender
yourself to the purposes of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fancy we must have sat in silence for quite a long while;
for the moon, creeping upward past the wood, had flooded the
fields again with light before Robina spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all love is needless,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we
could do better without it, choose with more discretion.&nbsp; If
it is only something that worries us for a little while and then
passes, what is the sense of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could ask the same question of Life itself,&rdquo;
I said; &ldquo;&lsquo;something that worries us for a little
while, then passes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps the &lsquo;worry,&rsquo;
as you call it, has its uses.&nbsp; Volcanic upheavals are
necessary to the making of a world.&nbsp; Without them the ground
would remain rock-bound, unfitted for its purposes.&nbsp; That
explosion of Youth&rsquo;s pent-up forces that we term Love
serves to the making of man and woman.&nbsp; It does not die, it
takes new shape.&nbsp; The blossom fades as the fruit
forms.&nbsp; The passion passes to give place to peace.&nbsp; The
trembling lover has become the helper, the comforter, the
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the failures,&rdquo; Robina persisted; &ldquo;I do
not mean the silly or the wicked people; but the people who begin
by really loving one another, only to end in
disliking&mdash;almost hating one another.&nbsp; How do
<i>they</i> get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I will tell you a
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time there was a girl, and a boy who loved
her.&nbsp; She was a clever, brilliant girl, and she had the face
of an angel.&nbsp; They lived near to one another, seeing each
other almost daily.&nbsp; But the boy, awed by the difference of
their social position, kept his secret, as he thought, to
himself; dreaming, as youth will, of the day when fame and wealth
would bridge the gulf between them.&nbsp; The kind look in her
eyes, the occasional seeming pressure of her hand, he allowed to
feed his hopes; and on the morning of his departure for London an
incident occurred that changed his vague imaginings to set
resolve.&nbsp; He had sent on his scanty baggage by the carrier,
intending to walk the three miles to the station.&nbsp; It was
early in the morning, and he had not expected to meet a
soul.&nbsp; But a mile from the village he overtook her.&nbsp;
She was reading a book, but she made no pretence that the meeting
was accidental, leaving him to form what conclusions he
would.&nbsp; She walked with him some distance, and he told her
of his plans and hopes; and she answered him quite simply that
she should always remember him, always be more glad than she
could tell to hear of his success.&nbsp; Near the end of the lane
they parted, she wishing him in that low sweet woman&rsquo;s
voice of hers all things good.&nbsp; He turned, a little farther
on, and found that she had also turned.&nbsp; She waved her hand
to him, smiling.&nbsp; And through the long day&rsquo;s journey
and through many days to come there remained with him that
picture of her, bringing with it the scent of the pine-woods: her
white hand waving to him, her sweet eyes smiling wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But fame and fortune are not won so quickly as boys
dream, nor is life as easy to live bravely as it looks in
visions.&nbsp; It was nearly twenty years before they met
again.&nbsp; Neither had married.&nbsp; Her people were dead and
she was living alone; and to him the world at last had opened her
doors.&nbsp; She was still beautiful.&nbsp; A gracious, gentle
lady, she had grown; clothed with that soft sweet dignity that
Time bestows upon rare women, rendering them fairer with the
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the man it seemed a miracle.&nbsp; The dream of
those early days came back to him.&nbsp; Surely there was nothing
now to separate them.&nbsp; Nothing had changed but the years,
bringing to them both wider sympathies, calmer, more enduring
emotions.&nbsp; She welcomed him again with the old kind smile, a
warmer pressure of the hand; and, allowing a little time to pass
for courtesy&rsquo;s sake, he told her what was the truth: that
he had never ceased to love her, never ceased to keep the vision
of her fair pure face before him, his ideal of all that man could
find of help in womanhood.&nbsp; And her answer, until years
later he read the explanation, remained a mystery to him.&nbsp;
She told him that she loved him, that she had never loved any
other man and never should; that his love, for so long as he
chose to give it to her, she should always prize as the greatest
gift of her life.&nbsp; But with that she prayed him to remain
content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thought perhaps it was a touch of woman&rsquo;s
pride, of hurt dignity that he had kept silent so long, not
trusting her; that perhaps as time went by she would change her
mind.&nbsp; But she never did; and after awhile, finding that his
persistence only pained her, he accepted the situation.&nbsp; She
was not the type of woman about whom people talk scandal, nor
would it have troubled her much had they done so.&nbsp; Able now
to work where he would, he took a house in a neighbouring
village, where for the best part of the year he lived, near to
her.&nbsp; And to the end they remained lovers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; said Robina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will tell you afterwards if I am wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told the story to a woman many years ago,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;and she also thought she understood.&nbsp; But she
was only half right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will see,&rdquo; said Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She left a letter, to be given to him after her death,
in case he survived her; if not, to be burned unopened.&nbsp; In
it she told him her reason, or rather her reasons, for having
refused him.&nbsp; It was an odd letter.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;reasons&rsquo; sounded so pitiably insufficient.&nbsp;
Until one took the pains to examine them in the cold light of
experience.&nbsp; And then her letter struck one, not as foolish,
but as one of the grimmest commentaries upon marriage that
perhaps had ever been penned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was because she had wished always to remain his
ideal; to keep their love for one another to the end,
untarnished; to be his true helpmeet in all things, that she had
refused to marry him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he spoken that morning she had waited for him in
the lane&mdash;she had half hoped, half feared it&mdash;she might
have given her promise: &lsquo;For Youth,&rsquo; so she wrote,
&lsquo;always dreams it can find a new way.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
thanked God that he had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sooner or later,&rsquo; so ran the letter,
&lsquo;you would have learned, Dear, that I was neither saint nor
angel; but just a woman&mdash;such a tiresome, inconsistent
creature; she would have exasperated you&mdash;full of a thousand
follies and irritabilities that would have marred for you all
that was good in her.&nbsp; I wanted you to have of me only what
was worthy, and this seemed the only way.&nbsp; Counting the
hours to your coming, hating the pain of your going, I could
always give to you my best.&nbsp; The ugly words, the whims and
frets that poison speech&mdash;they could wait; it was my
lover&rsquo;s hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And you, Dear, were always so tender, so
gay.&nbsp; You brought me joy with both your hands.&nbsp; Would
it have been the same, had you been my husband?&nbsp; How could
it?&nbsp; There were times, even as it was, when you vexed
me.&nbsp; Forgive me, Dear, I mean it was my fault&mdash;ways of
thought and action that did not fit in with my ways, that I was
not large-minded enough to pass over.&nbsp; As my lover, they
were but as spots upon the sun.&nbsp; It was easy to control the
momentary irritation that they caused me.&nbsp; Time was too
precious for even a moment of estrangement.&nbsp; As my husband,
the jarring note would have been continuous, would have widened
into discord.&nbsp; You see, Dear, I was not great enough to love
<i>all</i> of you.&nbsp; I remember, as a child, how indignant I
always felt with God when my nurse told me He would not love me
because I was naughty, that He only loved good children.&nbsp; It
seemed such a poor sort of love, that.&nbsp; Yet that is
precisely how we men and women do love; taking only what gives us
pleasure, repaying the rest with anger.&nbsp; There would have
arisen the unkind words that can never be recalled; the ugly
silences; the gradual withdrawing from one another.&nbsp; I dared
not face it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was not all selfishness.&nbsp; Truthfully I
can say I thought more of you than of myself.&nbsp; I wanted to
keep the shadows of life away from you.&nbsp; We men and women
are like the flowers.&nbsp; It is in sunshine that we come to our
best.&nbsp; You were my hero.&nbsp; I wanted you to be
great.&nbsp; I wanted you to be surrounded by lovely
dreams.&nbsp; I wanted your love to be a thing holy, helpful to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a long letter.&nbsp; I have given you the gist
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was a silence between us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think she did right?&rdquo; asked Robina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;there are no
rules for Life, only for the individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read it somewhere,&rdquo; said
Robina&mdash;&ldquo;where was it?&mdash;&lsquo;Love suffers all
things, and rejoices.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe in old Thomas Kempis.&nbsp; I am not sure,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Robina, &ldquo;that the
explanation lies in that one sentence of hers: &lsquo;I was not
great enough to love <i>all</i> of you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that the whole
art of marriage is the art of getting on with the other
fellow.&nbsp; It means patience, self-control, forbearance.&nbsp;
It means the laying aside of our self-conceit and admitting to
ourselves that, judged by eyes less partial than our own, there
may be much in us that is objectionable, that calls for
alteration.&nbsp; It means toleration for views and opinions
diametrically opposed to our most cherished convictions.&nbsp; It
means, of necessity, the abandonment of many habits and
indulgences that however trivial have grown to be important to
us.&nbsp; It means the shaping of our own desires to the needs of
others; the acceptance often of surroundings and conditions
personally distasteful to us.&nbsp; It means affection deep and
strong enough to bear away the ugly things of life&mdash;its
quarrels, wrongs, misunderstandings&mdash;swiftly and silently
into the sea of forgetfulness.&nbsp; It means courage, good
humour, commonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I am saying,&rdquo; explained
Robina.&nbsp; &ldquo;It means loving him even when he&rsquo;s
naughty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick came across the fields.&nbsp; Robina rose and slipped
into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are looking mighty solemn, Dad,&rdquo; said
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking of Life, Dick,&rdquo; I confessed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of the meaning and the explanation of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a problem, Life,&rdquo; admitted
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit of a teaser,&rdquo; I agreed.</p>
<p>We smoked in silence for awhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loving a good woman must be a tremendous help to a
man,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>He looked very handsome, very gallant, his boyish face
flashing challenge to the Fates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tremendous, Dick,&rdquo; I agreed.</p>
<p>Robina called to him that his supper was ready.&nbsp; He
knocked the ashes from his pipe, and followed her into the
house.&nbsp; Their laughing voices came to me broken through the
half-closed doors.&nbsp; From the night around me rose a strange
low murmur.&nbsp; It seemed to me as though above the silence I
heard the far-off music of the Mills of God.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">fancy</span> Veronica is going to be an
authoress.&nbsp; Her mother thinks this may account for many
things about her that have been troubling us.&nbsp; The story
never got far.&nbsp; It was laid aside for the more alluring work
of play-writing, and apparently forgotten.&nbsp; I came across
the copy-book containing her &ldquo;Rough Notes&rdquo; the other
day.&nbsp; There is decided flavour about them.&nbsp; I
transcribe selections; the spelling, as before, being my own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scene is laid in the Moon.&nbsp; But everything is
just the same as down here.&nbsp; With one exception.&nbsp; The
children rule.&nbsp; The grown-ups do not like it.&nbsp; But they
cannot help it.&nbsp; Something has happened to them.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t know what.&nbsp; And the world is as it used to
be.&nbsp; In the sweet old story-books.&nbsp; Before sin
came.&nbsp; There are fairies that dance o&rsquo; nights.&nbsp;
And Witches.&nbsp; That lure you.&nbsp; And then turn you into
things.&nbsp; And a dragon who lives in a cave.&nbsp; And springs
out at people.&nbsp; And eats them.&nbsp; So that you have to be
careful.&nbsp; And all the animals talk.&nbsp; And there are
giants.&nbsp; And lots of magic.&nbsp; And it is the children who
know everything.&nbsp; And what to do for it.&nbsp; And they have
to teach the grown-ups.&nbsp; And the grown-ups don&rsquo;t
believe half of it.&nbsp; And are far too fond of arguing.&nbsp;
Which is a sore trial to the children.&nbsp; But they have
patience, and are just.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the grown-ups have to go to school.&nbsp;
They have much to learn.&nbsp; Poor things!&nbsp; And they hate
it.&nbsp; They take no interest in fairy lore.&nbsp; And what
would happen to them if they got wrecked on a Desert Island they
don&rsquo;t seem to care.&nbsp; And then there are
languages.&nbsp; What they will need when they come to be
children.&nbsp; And have to talk to all the animals.&nbsp; And
magic.&nbsp; Which is deep.&nbsp; And they hate it.&nbsp; And say
it is rot.&nbsp; They are full of tricks.&nbsp; One catches them
reading trashy novels.&nbsp; Under the desk.&nbsp; All about
love.&nbsp; Which is wasting their children&rsquo;s money.&nbsp;
And God knows it is hard enough to earn.&nbsp; But the children
are not angry with them.&nbsp; Remembering how they felt
themselves.&nbsp; When they were grown up.&nbsp; Only firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children give them plenty of holidays.&nbsp;
Because holidays are good for everyone.&nbsp; They freshen you
up.&nbsp; But the grown-ups are very stupid.&nbsp; And do not
care for sensible games.&nbsp; Such as Indians.&nbsp; And
Pirates.&nbsp; What would sharpen their faculties.&nbsp; And so
fit them for the future.&nbsp; They only care to play with a
ball.&nbsp; Which is of no help.&nbsp; To the stern realities of
life.&nbsp; Or talk.&nbsp; Lord, how they talk!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one grown-up.&nbsp; Who is very clever.&nbsp;
He can talk about everything.&nbsp; But it leads to
nothing.&nbsp; And spoils the party.&nbsp; So they send him to
bed.&nbsp; And there are two grown-ups.&nbsp; A male and a
female.&nbsp; And they talk love.&nbsp; All the time.&nbsp; Even
on fine days.&nbsp; Which is maudlin.&nbsp; But the children are
patient with them.&nbsp; Knowing it takes all sorts.&nbsp; To
make a world.&nbsp; And trusting they will grow out of it.&nbsp;
And of course there are grown-ups who are good.&nbsp; And a
comfort to their children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And everything the children like is good.&nbsp; And
wholesome.&nbsp; And everything the grown-ups like is bad for
them.&nbsp; <i>And they mustn&rsquo;t have it</i>.&nbsp; They
clamour for tea and coffee.&nbsp; What undermines their nervous
system.&nbsp; And waste their money in the tuck shop.&nbsp; Upon
chops.&nbsp; And turtle soup.&nbsp; And the children have to put
them to bed.&nbsp; And give them pills.&nbsp; Till they feel
better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a little girl named Prue.&nbsp; Who lives with
a little boy named Simon.&nbsp; They mean well.&nbsp; But
haven&rsquo;t much sense.&nbsp; They have two grown-ups.&nbsp; A
male and a female.&nbsp; Named Peter and Martha.&nbsp;
Respectively.&nbsp; They are just the ordinary grown-ups.&nbsp;
Neither better nor worse.&nbsp; And much might be done with
them.&nbsp; By kindness.&nbsp; But Prue and Simon <i>go the wrong
way to work</i>.&nbsp; It is blame blame all day long.&nbsp; But
as for praise.&nbsp; Oh never!</p>
<p>&ldquo;One summer&rsquo;s day Prue and Simon take Peter for a
walk.&nbsp; In the country.&nbsp; And they meet a cow.&nbsp; And
they think this a good opportunity.&nbsp; To test Peter&rsquo;s
knowledge.&nbsp; Of languages.&nbsp; So they tell him to talk to
the cow.&nbsp; And he talks to the cow.&nbsp; And the cow
don&rsquo;t understand him.&nbsp; And he don&rsquo;t understand
the cow.&nbsp; And they are mad with him.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is
the use,&rsquo; they say.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of our paying expensive
fees.&nbsp; To have you taught the language.&nbsp; By a
first-class cow.&nbsp; And when you come out into the
country.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t talk it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he says
he did talk it.&nbsp; But they will not listen to him.&nbsp; But
go on raving.&nbsp; And in the end it turns out.&nbsp; <i>It was
a Jersey cow</i>!&nbsp; What talked a dialect.&nbsp; So of course
he couldn&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp; But did they
apologise?&nbsp; Oh dear no.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another time.&nbsp; One morning at breakfast.&nbsp;
Martha didn&rsquo;t like her raspberry vinegar.&nbsp; So she
didn&rsquo;t drink it.&nbsp; And Simon came into the
nursery.&nbsp; And he saw that Martha hadn&rsquo;t drunk her
raspberry vinegar.&nbsp; And he asked her why.&nbsp; And she said
she didn&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; Because it was nasty.&nbsp; And
he said it wasn&rsquo;t nasty.&nbsp; And that she <i>ought</i> to
like it.&nbsp; And how it was shocking.&nbsp; The way grown-ups
nowadays grumbled.&nbsp; At good wholesome food.&nbsp; Provided
for them by their too-indulgent children.&nbsp; And how when
<i>he</i> was a grown-up.&nbsp; He would never have dared.&nbsp;
And so on.&nbsp; All in the usual style.&nbsp; And to prove it
wasn&rsquo;t nasty.&nbsp; He poured himself out a cupful.&nbsp;
And drank it off.&nbsp; In a gulp.&nbsp; And he said it was
delicious.&nbsp; And turned pale.&nbsp; And left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Prue came into the nursery.&nbsp; And she saw that
Martha hadn&rsquo;t drunk her raspberry vinegar.&nbsp; And she
asked her why.&nbsp; And Martha told her how she didn&rsquo;t
like it.&nbsp; Because it was nasty.&nbsp; And Prue told her she
ought to be ashamed of herself.&nbsp; For not liking it.&nbsp;
Because it was good for her.&nbsp; And really very nice.&nbsp;
And anyhow she&rsquo;d <i>got</i> to like it.&nbsp; And not get
stuffing herself up with messy tea and coffee.&nbsp; Because she
wouldn&rsquo;t have it.&nbsp; And there was an end of it.&nbsp;
And so on.&nbsp; And to prove it was all right.&nbsp; She poured
herself out a cupful.&nbsp; And drank it off.&nbsp; In a
gulp.&nbsp; And she said there was nothing wrong with it.&nbsp;
Nothing whatever.&nbsp; And turned pale.&nbsp; And left the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t raspberry vinegar.&nbsp; But just
red ink.&nbsp; What had got put into the raspberry vinegar
decanter.&nbsp; By an oversight.&nbsp; And they needn&rsquo;t
have been ill at all.&nbsp; If only they had listened.&nbsp; To
poor old Martha.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; That was their fixed
idea.&nbsp; That grown-ups hadn&rsquo;t any sense.&nbsp; At
all.&nbsp; What is a mistake.&nbsp; As one perceives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other characters had been sketched, some of them to be
abandoned after a few bold touches: the difficulty of avoiding
too close a portraiture to the living original having apparently
proved irksome.&nbsp; Against one such, evidently an attempt to
help Dick see himself in his true colours, I find this marginal,
note in pencil: &ldquo;Better not.&nbsp; Might make him
ratty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Opposite to another&mdash;obviously of Mrs.
St. Leonard, and with instinct for alliteration&mdash;is
scribbled; &ldquo;Too terribly true.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d twig
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another character is that of a gent: &ldquo;With a certain
gift.&nbsp; For telling stories.&nbsp; Some of them <i>not
bad</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; A promising party, on the whole.&nbsp;
Indeed, one might say, judging from description, a quite rational
person: &ldquo;<i>When not on the rantan</i>.&nbsp; But
inconsistent.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is the grown-up of a little girl:
&ldquo;Not beautiful.&nbsp; But strangely attractive.&nbsp; Whom
we will call Enid.&rdquo; One gathers that if all the children
had been Enids, then surely the last word in worlds had been
said.&nbsp; She has only this one grown-up of her very own; but
she makes it her business to adopt and reform all the
incorrigible old folk the other children have despaired of.&nbsp;
It is all done by kindness.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is <i>ever</i>
patient.&nbsp; And just.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prominent among her
numerous <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i> is a military man, an
elderly colonel; until she took him in hand, the awful example of
what a grown-up might easily become, left to the care of
incompetent infants.&nbsp; He defies his own child, a virtuous
youth, but &ldquo;lacking in sympathy;&rdquo; is rude to his
little nephews and nieces; a holy terror to his governess.&nbsp;
He uses wicked words, picked up from retired pirates.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course without understanding.&nbsp; Their terrible
significance.&rdquo;&nbsp; He steals the Indian&rsquo;s
fire-water.&nbsp; &ldquo;What few can partake of.&nbsp; With
impunity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly not the Colonel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can this be he!&nbsp; This gibbering wreck!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He hides cigars in a hollow tree, and smokes on the sly.&nbsp; He
plays truant.&nbsp; Lures other old gentlemen away from their
lessons to join him.&nbsp; They are discovered in the woods, in a
cave, playing whist for sixpenny points.</p>
<p>Does Enid storm and bullyrag; threaten that if ever she
catches him so much as looking at a card again she will go
straight out and tell the dragon, who will in his turn be so
shocked that in all probability he will decide on coming back
with her to kill and eat the Colonel on the spot?&nbsp; No.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Such are not her methods.&rdquo;&nbsp; Instead she smiles:
&ldquo;indulgently.&rdquo;&nbsp; She says it is only natural for
grown-ups to like playing cards.&nbsp; She is not angry with
him.&nbsp; And there is no need for him to run away and hide in a
nasty damp cave.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>She herself will play whist with
him</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The effect upon the Colonel is immediate:
he bursts into tears.&nbsp; She plays whist with him in the
garden: &ldquo;After school hours.&nbsp; When he has been
<i>good</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Double dummy, one presumes.&nbsp; One
leaves the Colonel, in the end, cured of his passion for
whist.&nbsp; Whether as the consequence of her play or her
influence the &ldquo;Rough Notes&rdquo; give no indication.</p>
<p>In the play, I am inclined to think, Veronica received
assistance.&nbsp; The house had got itself finished early in
September.&nbsp; Young Bute has certainly done wonders.&nbsp; We
performed it in the empty billiard-room, followed by a one-act
piece of my own.&nbsp; The occasion did duty as a
house-warming.&nbsp; We had quite a crowd, and ended up with a
dance.&nbsp; Everybody seemed to enjoy themselves, except young
Bertie St. Leonard, who played the Prince, and could not get out
of his helmet in time for supper.&nbsp; It was a good helmet, but
had been fastened clumsily; and inexperienced people trying to
help had only succeeded in jambing all the screws.&nbsp; Not only
wouldn&rsquo;t it come off, it would not even open for a
drink.&nbsp; All thought it an excellent joke, with the exception
of young Herbert St. Leonard.&nbsp; Our Mayor, a cheerful little
man and very popular, said that it ought to be sent to
<i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; The local reporter reminded him that the late
John Leech had already made use of precisely the same incident
for a comic illustration, afterwards remembering that it was not
Leech, but the late Phil May.&nbsp; He seemed to think this ended
the matter.&nbsp; St. Leonard and the Vicar, who are rival
authorities upon the subject, fell into an argument upon armour
in general, with special reference to the fourteenth
century.&nbsp; Each used the boy&rsquo;s head to confirm his own
theory, passing it triumphantly from one to the other.&nbsp; We
had to send off young Hopkins in the donkey-cart for the
blacksmith.&nbsp; I have found out, by the way, how it is young
Hopkins makes our donkey go.&nbsp; Young Hopkins argues it is far
less brutal than whacking him, especially after experience has
proved that he evidently does not know why you are whacking
him.&nbsp; I am not at all sure the boy is not right.</p>
<p>Janie played the Fairy Godmamma in a white wig and
panniers.&nbsp; She will make a beautiful old lady.&nbsp; The
white hair gives her the one thing that she lacks:
distinction.&nbsp; I found myself glancing apprehensively round
the room, wishing we had not invited so many eligible
bachelors.&nbsp; Dick is making me anxious.&nbsp; The sense of
his own unworthiness, which has come to him quite suddenly, and
apparently with all the shock of a new discovery, has completely
unnerved him.&nbsp; It is a healthy sentiment, and does him
good.&nbsp; But I do not want it carried to the length of losing
her.&nbsp; The thought of what he might one day bring home has
been a nightmare to me ever since he left school.&nbsp; I suppose
it is to most fathers.&nbsp; Especially if one thinks of the
women one loved oneself when in the early twenties.&nbsp; A large
pale-faced girl, who served in a bun-shop in the Strand, is the
first I can recollect.&nbsp; How I trembled when by chance her
hand touched mine!&nbsp; I cannot recall a single attraction
about her except her size, yet for nearly six months I lunched
off pastry and mineral waters merely to be near her.&nbsp; To
this very day an attack of indigestion will always recreate her
image in my mind.&nbsp; Another was a thin, sallow girl, but with
magnificent eyes, I met one afternoon in the South Kensington
Museum.&nbsp; She was a brainless, vixenish girl, but the memory
of her eyes would always draw me back to her.&nbsp; More than
two-thirds of our time together we spent in violent quarrels; and
all my hopes of eternity I would have given to make her my
companion for life.&nbsp; But for Luck, in the shape of a
well-to-do cab proprietor, as great an idiot as myself I might
have done it.&nbsp; The third was a chorus girl: on the whole,
the best of the bunch.&nbsp; Her father was a coachman, and she
had ten brothers and sisters, most of them doing well in
service.&nbsp; And she was succeeded&mdash;if I have the order
correct&mdash;by the ex-wife of a solicitor, a sprightly lady;
according to her own account the victim of complicated
injustice.&nbsp; I daresay there were others, if I took the time
to think; but not one of them can I remember without returning
thanks to Providence for having lost her.&nbsp; What is one to
do?&nbsp; There are days in springtime when a young man ought not
to be allowed outside the house.&nbsp; Thank Heaven and
Convention it is not the girls who propose!&nbsp; Few women, who
would choose the right moment to put their hands upon a young
man&rsquo;s shoulders, and, looking into his eyes, ask him to
marry them next week, would receive No for an answer.&nbsp; It is
only our shyness that saves us.&nbsp; A wise friend of mine, who
has observed much, would have all those marrying under
five-and-twenty divorced by automatic effluxion of time at forty,
leaving the few who had chosen satisfactorily to be reunited if
they wished: his argument being that to condemn grown men and
women to abide by the choice of inexperienced boys and girls is
unjust and absurd.&nbsp; There were nice girls I could have
fallen in love with.&nbsp; They never occurred to me.&nbsp; It
would seem as if a man had to learn taste in women as in all
other things, namely, by education.&nbsp; Here and there may
exist the born connoisseur.&nbsp; But with most of us our first
instincts are towards vulgarity.&nbsp; It is Barrie, I think, who
says that if only there were silly women enough to go round, good
women would never get a look in.&nbsp; It is certainly
remarkable, the number of sweet old maids one meets.&nbsp; Almost
as remarkable as the number of stupid, cross-grained wives.&nbsp;
As I tell Dick, I have no desire for a daughter-in-law of whom he
feels himself worthy.&nbsp; If he can&rsquo;t do better than that
he had best remain single.&nbsp; Janie and he, if I know anything
of life, are just suited for one another.&nbsp; Helpful people
take their happiness in helping.&nbsp; I knew just such another,
once: a sweet, industrious, sensible girl.&nbsp; She made the
mistake of marrying a thoroughly good man.&nbsp; There was
nothing for her to do.&nbsp; She ended by losing all interest in
him, devoting herself to a Home in the East End for the
reformation of newsboys.&nbsp; It was a pitiful waste: so many
women would have been glad of him; while to the ordinary sinful
man she would have been a life-long comfort.&nbsp; I must have a
serious talk to Dick.&nbsp; I shall point out what a good thing
it will be for her.&nbsp; I can see Dick keeping her busy and
contented for the rest of her days.</p>
<p>Veronica played the Princess,&mdash;with little boy
Foy&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Robert of the Curse&rdquo;&mdash;as her
page.&nbsp; Anything more dignified has, I should say, rarely
been seen upon the English stage.&nbsp; Among her wedding
presents were: Two Votes for Women, presented by the local Fire
Brigade; a Flying Machine of &ldquo;proved stability.&nbsp; Might
be used as a bathing tent;&rdquo; a National Theatre, &ldquo;with
Cold Water Douche in Basement for reception of English
Dramatists;&rdquo; Recipe for building a Navy, without paying for
it, &ldquo;Gift of that great Financial Expert, Sir Hocus
Pocus;&rdquo; one Conscientious Income Taxpayer, &ldquo;has been
driven by a Lady;&rdquo; two Socialists in agreement as to what
it means, &ldquo;smaller one slightly damaged;&rdquo; one
Contented Farmer, &ldquo;Babylonian Period;&rdquo; and one
extra-sized bottle, &ldquo;Solution of the Servant
Problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick played the &ldquo;Dragon without a Tail.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
had to make him without a tail owing to the smallness of the
stage.&nbsp; He had once had a tail.&nbsp; But that was a long
story: added to which there was not time to tell it.&nbsp; Little
Sally St. Leonard played his wife, and Robina was his
mother-in-law.&nbsp; So much depends upon one&rsquo;s mood.&nbsp;
What an ocean of boredom might be saved if science could but give
us a barometer foretelling us our changes of temperament!&nbsp;
How much more to our comfort we could plan our lives, knowing
that on Monday, say, we should be feeling frivolous; on Saturday
&ldquo;dull to bad-tempered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took a man once to see <i>The Private Secretary</i>.&nbsp; I
began by enjoying myself, and ended by feeling ashamed of myself
and vexed with the scheme of creation.&nbsp; That authors should
write such plays, that actors should be willing to degrade our
common nature by appearing in them was explainable, he supposed,
by the law of supply and demand.&nbsp; What he could not
understand was how the public could contrive to extract amusement
from them.&nbsp; What was there funny in seeing a poor gentleman
shut up in a box?&nbsp; Why should everybody roar with laughter
when he asked for a bun?&nbsp; People asked for buns every
day&mdash;people in railway refreshment rooms, in aerated bread
shops.&nbsp; Where was the joke?&nbsp; A month later I found
myself by chance occupying the seat just behind him at the
pantomime.&nbsp; The low comedian was bathing a baby, and tears
of merriment were rolling down his cheeks.&nbsp; To me the whole
business seemed painful and revolting.&nbsp; We were being asked
to find delight in the spectacle of a father&mdash;scouring down
an infant of tender years with a scrubbing-brush.&nbsp; How
women&mdash;many of them mothers&mdash;could remain through such
an exhibition without rising in protest appeared to me an
argument against female suffrage.&nbsp; A lady entered, the wife,
so the programme informed me, of a Baron!&nbsp; All I can say is
that a more vulgar, less prepossessing female I never wish to
meet.&nbsp; I even doubted her sobriety.&nbsp; She sat down plump
upon the baby.&nbsp; She must have been a woman rising sixteen
stone, and for one minute fifteen seconds by my watch the whole
house rocked with laughter.&nbsp; That the thing was only a stage
property I felt was no excuse.&nbsp; The humour&mdash;heaven save
the mark&mdash;lay in the supposition that what we were
witnessing was the agony and death&mdash;for no child could have
survived that woman&rsquo;s weight&mdash;of a real baby.&nbsp;
Had I been able to tap myself beforehand I should have learned
that on that particular Saturday I was going to be
&ldquo;set-serious.&rdquo;&nbsp; Instead of booking a seat for
the pantomime I should have gone to a lecture on Egyptian pottery
which was being given by a friend of mine at the London Library,
and have had a good time.</p>
<p>Children could tap their parents, warn each other that father
was &ldquo;going down;&rdquo; that mother next week was likely to
be &ldquo;gusty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Children themselves might hang out
their little barometers.&nbsp; I remember a rainy day in a
country house during the Christmas holidays.&nbsp; We had among
us a Member of Parliament: a man of sunny disposition, extremely
fond of children.&nbsp; He said it was awfully hard lines on the
little beggars cooped up in a nursery; and borrowing his
host&rsquo;s motor-coat, pretended he was a bear.&nbsp; He
plodded round on his hands and knees and growled a good deal, and
the children sat on the sofa and watched him.&nbsp; But they
didn&rsquo;t seem to be enjoying it, not much; and after a
quarter of an hour or so he noticed this himself.&nbsp; He
thought it was, maybe, that they were tired of bears, and fancied
that a whale might rouse them.&nbsp; He turned the table upside
down and placed the children in it on three chairs, explaining to
them that they were ship-wrecked sailors on a raft, and that they
must be careful the whale did not get underneath it and upset
them.&nbsp; He draped a sheet over the towel-horse to represent
an iceberg, and rolled himself up in a mackintosh and flopped
about the floor on his stomach, butting his head occasionally
against the table in order to suggest to them their danger.&nbsp;
The attitude of the children still remained that of polite
spectators.&nbsp; True, the youngest boy did make the suggestion
of borrowing the kitchen toasting-fork, and employing it as a
harpoon; but even this appeared to be the outcome rather of a
desire to please than of any warmer interest; and, the whale
objecting, the idea fell through.&nbsp; After that he climbed up
on the dresser and announced to them that he was an
ourang-outang.&nbsp; They watched him break a soup-tureen, and
then the eldest boy, stepping out into the middle of the room,
held up his arm, and the Member of Parliament, somewhat
surprised, sat down on the dresser and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; said the eldest boy,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re awfully sorry.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s awfully good
of you, sir.&nbsp; But somehow we&rsquo;re not feeling in the
mood for wild beasts this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Member of Parliament brought them down into the
drawing-room, where we had music; and the children, at their own
request, were allowed to sing hymns.&nbsp; The next day they came
of their own accord, and asked the Member of Parliament to play
at beasts with them; but it seemed he had letters to write.</p>
<p>There are times when jokes about mothers-in-law strike me as
lacking both in taste and freshness.&nbsp; On this particular
evening they came to me bringing with them all the fragrance of
the days that are no more.&nbsp; The first play I ever saw dealt
with the subject of the mother-in-law&mdash;the
&ldquo;Problem&rdquo; I think it was called in those days.&nbsp;
The occasion was an amateur performance given in aid of the local
Ragged School.&nbsp; A cousin of mine, lately married, played the
wife; and my aunt, I remember, got up and walked out in the
middle of the second act.&nbsp; Robina, in spectacles and an
early Victorian bonnet, reminded me of her.&nbsp; Young Bute
played a comic cabman.&nbsp; It was at the old Haymarket, in
Buckstone&rsquo;s time, that I first met the cabman of art and
literature.&nbsp; Dear bibulous, becoated creature, with
ever-wrathful outstretched palm and husky
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere!&nbsp; Wot&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;&nbsp; How good
it was to see him once again!&nbsp; I felt I wanted to climb over
the foot-lights and shake him by the hand.&nbsp; The twins played
a couple of Young Turks, much concerned about their
constitutions; and made quite a hit with a topical duet to the
refrain: &ldquo;And so you see The reason he Is not the Boss for
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; We all agreed it was a pun worthy of Tom Hood
himself.&nbsp; The Vicar thought he had heard it before, but this
seemed improbable.&nbsp; There was a unanimous call for Author,
giving rise to sounds of discussion behind the curtain.&nbsp;
Eventually the whole company appeared, with Veronica in the
centre.&nbsp; I had noticed throughout that the centre of the
stage appeared to be Veronica&rsquo;s favourite spot.&nbsp; I can
see the makings of a leading actress in Veronica.</p>
<p>In my own piece, which followed, Robina and Bute played a
young married couple who do not know how to quarrel.&nbsp; It has
always struck me how much more satisfactorily people quarrel on
the stage than in real life.&nbsp; On the stage the man, having
made up his mind&mdash;to have it out, enters and closes the
door.&nbsp; He lights a cigarette; if not a teetotaller mixes
himself a brandy-and-soda.&nbsp; His wife all this time is
careful to remain silent.&nbsp; Quite evident it is that he is
preparing for her benefit something unpleasant, and chatter might
disturb him.&nbsp; To fill up the time she toys with a novel or
touches softly the keys of the piano until he is quite
comfortable and ready to begin.&nbsp; He glides into his subject
with the studied calm of one with all the afternoon before
him.&nbsp; She listens to him in rapt attention.&nbsp; She does
not dream of interrupting him; would scorn the suggestion of
chipping in with any little notion of her own likely to
disarrange his train of thought.&nbsp; All she does when he
pauses, as occasionally he has to for the purpose of taking
breath, is to come to his assistance with short encouraging
remarks, such, for instance, as: &ldquo;Well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You think that.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And if I
did?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her object seems to be to help him on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she says from time to time, bitterly.&nbsp;
And he goes on.&nbsp; Towards the end, when he shows signs of
easing up, she puts it to him as one sportsman to another: Is he
quite finished?&nbsp; Is that all?&nbsp; Sometimes it
isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; As often as not he has been saving the pick of
the basket for the last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that is not all.&nbsp; There
is something else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is quite enough for her.&nbsp; That is all she wanted to
know.&nbsp; She merely asked in case there might be.&nbsp; As it
appears there is, she re-settles herself in her chair and is
again all ears.</p>
<p>When it does come&mdash;when he is quite sure there is nothing
he has forgotten, no little point that he has overlooked, she
rises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have listened patiently,&rdquo; she begins, &ldquo;to
all that you have said.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The devil himself could not
deny this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Patience&rdquo; hardly seems the
word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Enthusiastically&rdquo; she might almost have
said).&nbsp; &ldquo;Now&rdquo;&mdash;with rising
inflection&mdash;&ldquo;you listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stage husband&mdash;always the
gentleman&mdash;bows;&mdash;stiffly maybe, but quite politely;
and prepares in his turn to occupy the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of dumb
but dignified defendant.&nbsp; To emphasise the coming change in
their positions, the lady most probably crosses over to what has
hitherto been his side of the stage; while he, starting at the
same moment, and passing her about the centre, settles himself
down in what must be regarded as the listener&rsquo;s end of the
room.&nbsp; We then have the whole story over again from her
point of view; and this time it is the gentleman who would bite
off his tongue rather than make a retort calculated to put the
lady off.</p>
<p>In the end it is the party who is in the right that
conquers.&nbsp; Off the stage this is more or less of a toss-up;
on the stage, never.&nbsp; If justice be with the husband, then
it is his voice that, gradually growing louder and louder, rings
at last triumphant through the house.&nbsp; The lady sees herself
that she has been to blame, and wonders why it did not occur to
her before&mdash;is grateful for the revelation, and asks to be
forgiven.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, it was the husband who was
at fault, then it is the lady who will be found eventually
occupying the centre of the stage; the miserable husband who,
morally speaking, will be trying to get under the table.</p>
<p>Now, in real life things don&rsquo;t happen quite like
this.&nbsp; What the quarrel in real life suffers from is want of
system.&nbsp; There is no order, no settled plan.&nbsp; There is
much too much go-as-you-please about the quarrel in real life,
and the result is naturally pure muddle.&nbsp; The man, turning
things over in the morning while shaving, makes up his mind to
have this matter out and have done with it.&nbsp; He knows
exactly what he is going to say.&nbsp; He repeats it to himself
at intervals during the day.&nbsp; He will first say This, and
then he will go on to That; while he is about it he will perhaps
mention the Other.&nbsp; He reckons it will take him a quarter of
an hour.&nbsp; Which will just give him time to dress for
dinner.</p>
<p>After it is over, and he looks at his watch, he finds it has
taken him longer than that.&nbsp; Added to which he has said next
to nothing&mdash;next to nothing, that is, of what he meant to
say.&nbsp; It went wrong from the very start.&nbsp; As a matter
of fact there wasn&rsquo;t any start.&nbsp; He entered the room
and closed the door.&nbsp; That is as far as he got.&nbsp; The
cigarette he never even lighted.&nbsp; There ought to have been a
box of matches on the mantelpiece behind the photo-frame.&nbsp;
And of course there were none there.&nbsp; For her to fly into a
temper merely because he reminded her that he had spoken about
this very matter at least a hundred times before, and accuse him
of going about his own house &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; his own
matches was positively laughable.&nbsp; They had quarrelled for
about five minutes over those wretched matches, and then for
another ten because he said that women had no sense of humour,
and she wanted to know how he knew.&nbsp; After that there had
cropped up the last quarter&rsquo;s gas-bill, and that by a
process still mysterious to him had led them into the subject of
his behaviour on the night of the Hockey Club dance.&nbsp; By an
effort of almost supernatural self-control he had contrived at
length to introduce the subject he had come home half an hour
earlier than usual on purpose to discuss.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t
interest her in the least.&nbsp; What she was full of by this
time was a girl named Arabella Jones.&nbsp; She got in quite a
lot while he was vainly trying to remember where he had last seen
the damned girl.&nbsp; He had just succeeded in getting back to
his own topic when the Cuddiford girl from next door dashed in
without a hat to borrow a tuning-fork.&nbsp; It had been quite a
business finding the tuning-fork, and when she was gone they had
to begin all over again.&nbsp; They had quarrelled about the
drawing-room carpet; about her sister Florrie&rsquo;s birthday
present; and the way he drove the motor-car.&nbsp; It had taken
them over an hour and a half, and rather than waste the tickets
for the theatre, they had gone without their dinner.&nbsp; The
matter of the cold chisel still remained to be thrashed out.</p>
<p>It had occurred to me that through the medium of the drama I
might show how the domestic quarrel could so easily be
improved.&nbsp; Adolphus Goodbody, a worthy young man deeply
attached to his wife, feels nevertheless that the dinners she is
inflicting upon him are threatening with permanent damage his
digestive system.&nbsp; He determines, come what may, to insist
upon a change.&nbsp; Elvira Goodbody, a charming girl, admiring
and devoted to her husband, is notwithstanding a trifle <i>en
t&ecirc;te</i>, especially when her domestic arrangements happen
to be the theme of discussion.&nbsp; Adolphus, his courage
screwed to the sticking-point, broaches the difficult subject;
and for the first half of the act my aim was to picture the
progress of the human quarrel, not as it should be, but as it
is.&nbsp; They never reach the cook.&nbsp; The first mention of
the word &ldquo;dinner&rdquo; reminds Elvira (quick to perceive
that argument is brewing, and alive to the advantage of getting
in first) that twice the month before he had dined out, not
returning till the small hours of the morning.&nbsp; What she
wants to know is where this sort of thing is going to end?&nbsp;
If the purpose of Freemasonry is the ruin of the home and the
desertion of women, then all she has to say&mdash;it turns out to
be quite a good deal.&nbsp; Adolphus, when able to get in a word,
suggests that eleven o&rsquo;clock at the latest can hardly be
described as the &ldquo;small hours of the morning&rdquo;: the
fault with women is that they never will confine themselves to
the simple truth.&nbsp; From that point onwards, as can be
imagined, the scene almost wrote itself.&nbsp; They have passed
through all the customary stages, and are planning, with
exaggerated calm, arrangements for the separation which each now
feels to be inevitable, when a knock comes to the front-door, and
there enters a mutual friend.</p>
<p>Their hasty attempts to cover up the traces of mental disorder
with which the atmosphere is strewed do not deceive him.&nbsp;
There has been, let us say, a ripple on the waters of perfect
agreement.&nbsp; Come!&nbsp; What was it all about?</p>
<p>&ldquo;About!&rdquo;&nbsp; They look from one to the
other.&nbsp; Surely it would be simpler to tell him what it had
<i>not</i> been about.&nbsp; It had been about the parrot, about
her want of punctuality, about his using the butter-knife for the
marmalade, about a pair of slippers he had lost at Christmas,
about the education question, and her dressmaker&rsquo;s bill,
and his friend George, and the next-door dog&mdash;</p>
<p>The mutual friend cuts short the catalogue.&nbsp; Clearly
there is nothing for it but to begin the quarrel all over again;
and this time, if they will put themselves into his hands, he
feels sure he can promise victory to whichever one is in the
right.</p>
<p>Elvira&mdash;she has a sweet, impulsive nature&mdash;throws
her arms around him: that is all she wants.&nbsp; If only
Adolphus could be brought to see!&nbsp; Adolphus grips him by the
hand.&nbsp; If only Elvira would listen to sense!</p>
<p>The mutual friend&mdash;he is an old
stage-manager&mdash;arranges the scene: Elvira in easy-chair by
fire with crochet.&nbsp; Enter Adolphus.&nbsp; He lights a
cigarette; flings the match on the floor; with his hands in his
pockets paces up and down the room; kicks a footstool out of his
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me when I am to begin,&rdquo; says Elvira.</p>
<p>The mutual friend promises to give her the right cue.</p>
<p>Adolphus comes to a halt in the centre of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, my dear,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but there
is something I must say to you&mdash;something that may not be
altogether pleasant for you to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Elvira, still crocheting, replies, &ldquo;Oh,
indeed.&nbsp; And pray what may that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not Elvira&rsquo;s own idea.&nbsp; Springing from her
chair, she had got as far as: &ldquo;Look here.&nbsp; If you have
come home early merely for the purpose of making a
row&mdash;&rdquo; before the mutual friend could stop her.&nbsp;
The mutual friend was firm.&nbsp; Only by exacting strict
obedience could he guarantee a successful issue.&nbsp; What she
had got to say was, &ldquo;Oh, indeed.&nbsp;
Etcetera.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mutual friend had need of all his tact
to prevent its becoming a quarrel of three.</p>
<p>Adolphus, allowed to proceed, explained that the subject about
which he wished to speak was the subject of dinner.&nbsp; The
mutual friend this time was beforehand.&nbsp; Elvira&rsquo;s
retort to that was: &ldquo;Dinner!&nbsp; You complain of the
dinners I provide for you?&rdquo; enabling him to reply,
&ldquo;Yes, madam, I do complain,&rdquo; and to give
reasons.&nbsp; It seemed to Elvira that the mutual friend had
lost his senses.&nbsp; To tell her to &ldquo;wait&rdquo;; that
&ldquo;her time would come&rdquo;; of what use was that!&nbsp;
Half of what she wanted to say would be gone out of her
head.&nbsp; Adolphus brought to a conclusion his criticism of
Elvira&rsquo;s kitchen; and then Elvira, incapable of restraining
herself further, rose majestically.</p>
<p>The mutual friend was saved the trouble of suppressing
Adolphus.&nbsp; Until Elvira had finished Adolphus never got an
opening.&nbsp; He grumbled at their dinners.&nbsp; He! who can
dine night after night with his precious Freemasons.&nbsp; Does
he think she likes them any better?&nbsp; She, doomed to stay at
home and eat them.&nbsp; What does he take her for?&nbsp; An
ostrich?&nbsp; Whose fault is it that they keep an incompetent
cook too old to learn and too obstinate to want to?&nbsp; Whose
old family servant was she?&nbsp; Not Elvira&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It
has been to please Adolphus that she has suffered the
woman.&nbsp; And this is her reward.&nbsp; This!&nbsp; She breaks
down.&nbsp; Adolphus is astonished and troubled.&nbsp; Personally
he never liked the woman.&nbsp; Faithful she may have been, but a
cook never.&nbsp; His own idea, had he been consulted, would have
been a small pension.&nbsp; Elvira falls upon his neck.&nbsp; Why
did he not say so before?&nbsp; Adolphus presses her to his
bosom.&nbsp; If only he had known!&nbsp; They promise the mutual
friend never to quarrel again without his assistance.</p>
<p>The acting all round was quite good.&nbsp; Our curate, who is
a bachelor, said it taught a lesson.&nbsp; Veronica had tears in
her eyes.&nbsp; She whispered to me that she thought it
beautiful.&nbsp; There is more in Veronica than people think.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> sorry the house is
finished.&nbsp; There is a proverb: &ldquo;Fools build houses for
wise men to live in.&rdquo;&nbsp; It depends upon what you are
after.&nbsp; The fool gets the fun, and the wise men the bricks
and mortar.&nbsp; I remember a whimsical story I picked up at the
bookstall of the Gare de Lyon.&nbsp; I read it between Paris and
Fontainebleau many years ago.&nbsp; Three friends, youthful
Bohemians, smoking their pipes after the meagre dinner of a cheap
restaurant in the Latin Quarter, fell to thinking of their
poverty, of the long and bitter struggle that lay before
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My themes are so original,&rdquo; sighed the
Musician.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will take me a year of
<i>f&ecirc;te</i> days to teach the public to understand them,
even if ever I do succeed.&nbsp; And meanwhile I shall live
unknown, neglected; watching the men without ideals passing me by
in the race, splashed with the mud from their carriage-wheels as
I beat the pavements with worn shoes.&nbsp; It is really a most
unjust world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An abominable world,&rdquo; agreed the Poet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But think of me!&nbsp; My case is far harder than
yours.&nbsp; Your gift lies within you.&nbsp; Mine is to
translate what lies around me; and that, for so far ahead as I
can see, will always be the shadow side of life.&nbsp; To develop
my genius to its fullest I need the sunshine of existence.&nbsp;
My soul is being starved for lack of the beautiful things of
life.&nbsp; A little of the wealth that vulgar people waste would
make a great poet for France.&nbsp; It is not only of myself that
I am thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Painter laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot soar to your
heights,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Frankly speaking, it is
myself that chiefly appeals to me.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; I give
the world Beauty, and in return what does it give me?&nbsp; This
dingy restaurant, where I eat ill-flavoured food off hideous
platters, a foul garret giving on to chimney-pots.&nbsp; After
long years of ill-requited labour I may&mdash;as others have
before me&mdash;come into my kingdom: possess my studio in the
Champs Elys&eacute;es, my fine house at Neuilly; but the prospect
of the intervening period, I confess, appals me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absorbed in themselves, they had not noticed that a stranger,
seated at a neighbouring table, had been listening with
attention.&nbsp; He rose and, apologising with easy grace for
intrusion into a conversation he could hardly have avoided
overhearing, requested permission to be of service.&nbsp; The
restaurant was dimly lighted; the three friends on entering had
chosen its obscurest corner.&nbsp; The Stranger appeared to be
well-dressed; his voice and bearing suggested the man of affairs;
his face&mdash;what feeble light there was being behind
him&mdash;remained in shadow.</p>
<p>The three friends eyed him furtively: possibly some rich but
eccentric patron of the arts; not beyond the bounds of
speculation that he was acquainted with their work, had read the
Poet&rsquo;s verses in one of the minor magazines, had stumbled
upon some sketch of the Painter&rsquo;s while bargain-hunting
among the dealers of the Quartier St. Antoine, been struck by the
beauty of the Composer&rsquo;s Nocturne in F heard at some
student&rsquo;s concert; having made enquiries concerning their
haunts, had chosen this method of introducing himself.&nbsp; The
young men made room for him with feelings of hope mingled with
curiosity.&nbsp; The affable Stranger called for liqueurs, and
handed round his cigar-case.&nbsp; And almost his first words
brought them joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go further,&rdquo; said the smiling Stranger,
&ldquo;it is my pleasure to inform you that all three of you are
destined to become great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The liqueurs to their unaccustomed palates were proving
potent.&nbsp; The Stranger&rsquo;s cigars were singularly
aromatic.&nbsp; It seemed the most reasonable thing in the world
that the Stranger should be thus able to foretell to them their
future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fame, fortune will be yours,&rdquo; continued the
agreeable Stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;All things delightful will be to
your hand: the adoration of women, the honour of men, the incense
of Society, joys spiritual and material, beauteous surroundings,
choice foods, all luxury and ease, the world your
pleasure-ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stained walls of the dingy restaurant were fading into
space before the young men&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; They saw
themselves as gods walking in the garden of their hearts&rsquo;
desires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, alas,&rdquo; went on the Stranger&mdash;and with
the first note of his changed voice the visions vanished, the
dingy walls came back&mdash;&ldquo;these things take time.&nbsp;
You will, all three, be well past middle-age before you will reap
the just reward of your toil and talents.&nbsp;
Meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo; the sympathetic Stranger shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;it is the old story: genius spending its
youth battling for recognition against indifference, ridicule,
envy; the spirit crushed by its sordid environment, the drab
monotony of narrow days.&nbsp; There will be winter nights when
you will tramp the streets, cold, hungry, forlorn; summer days
when you will hide in your attics, ashamed of the sunlight on
your ragged garments; chill dawns when you will watch wild-eyed
the suffering of those you love, helpless by reason of your
poverty to alleviate their pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stranger paused while the ancient waiter replenished the
empty glasses.&nbsp; The three friends drank in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I propose,&rdquo; said the Stranger, with a pleasant
laugh, &ldquo;that we pass over this customary period of
probation&mdash;that we skip the intervening years&mdash;arrive
at once at our true destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stranger, leaning back in his chair, regarded the three
friends with a smile they felt rather than saw.&nbsp; And
something about the Stranger&mdash;they could not have told
themselves what&mdash;made all things possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quite simple matter,&rdquo; the Stranger assured
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;A little sleep and a forgetting, and the years
lie behind us.&nbsp; Come, gentlemen.&nbsp; Have I your
consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed a question hardly needing answer.&nbsp; To escape at
one stride the long, weary struggle; to enter without fighting
into victory!&nbsp; The young men looked at one another.&nbsp;
And each one, thinking of his gain, bartered the battle for the
spoil.</p>
<p>It seemed to them that suddenly the lights went out; and a
darkness like a rushing wind swept past them, filled with many
sounds.&nbsp; And then forgetfulness.&nbsp; And then the coming
back of light.</p>
<p>They were seated at a table, glittering with silver and dainty
chinaware, to which the red wine in Venetian goblets, the varied
fruit and flowers, gave colour.&nbsp; The room, furnished too
gorgeously for taste, they judged to be a private cabinet in one
of the great restaurants.&nbsp; Of such interiors they had
occasionally caught glimpses through open windows on summer
nights.&nbsp; It was softly illuminated by shaded lamps.&nbsp;
The Stranger&rsquo;s face was still in shadow.&nbsp; But what
surprised each of the three most was to observe opposite him two
more or less bald-headed gentlemen of somewhat flabby appearance,
whose features, however, in some mysterious way appeared
familiar.&nbsp; The Stranger had his wine-glass raised in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our dear Paul,&rdquo; the Stranger was saying,
&ldquo;has declined, with his customary modesty, any public
recognition of his triumph.&nbsp; He will not refuse three old
friends the privilege of offering him their heartiest
congratulations.&nbsp; Gentlemen, I drink not only to our dear
Paul, but to the French Academy, which in honouring him has
honoured France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stranger, rising from his chair, turned his piercing
eyes&mdash;the only part of him that could be clearly
seen&mdash;upon the astonished Poet.&nbsp; The two elderly
gentlemen opposite, evidently as bewildered as Paul himself,
taking their cue from the Stranger, drained their glasses.&nbsp;
Still following the Stranger&rsquo;s lead, leant each across the
table and shook him warmly by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; said the Poet, &ldquo;but really I
am afraid I must have been asleep.&nbsp; Would it sound rude to
you&rdquo;&mdash;he addressed himself to the Stranger: the faces
of the elderly gentlemen opposite did not suggest their being of
much assistance to him&mdash;&ldquo;if I asked you where I
was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there flickered across the Stranger&rsquo;s face the
smile that was felt rather than seen.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are in a
private room of the Caf&eacute; Pretali,&rdquo; he
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are met this evening to celebrate your
recent elevation into the company of the Immortals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Poet, &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Academy,&rdquo; continued the Stranger, &ldquo;is
always a little late in these affairs.&nbsp; Myself, I could have
wished your election had taken place ten years ago, when all
France&mdash;all France that counts, that is&mdash;was talking of
you.&nbsp; At fifty-three&rdquo;&mdash;the Stranger touched
lightly with his fingers the Poet&rsquo;s fat
hand&mdash;&ldquo;one does not write as when the sap was running
up, instead of down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, memory of the dingy <i>caf&eacute;</i> in the Rue St.
Louis, of the strange happening that took place there that night
when he was young, crept back into the Poet&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind,&rdquo; said the Poet, &ldquo;would it
be troubling you too much to tell me something of what has
occurred to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; responded the agreeable
Stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your career has been most
interesting&mdash;for the first few years chiefly to
yourself.&nbsp; You married Marguerite.&nbsp; You remember
Marguerite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Poet remembered her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mad thing to do, so most people would have
said,&rdquo; continued the Stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had not a
sou between you.&nbsp; But, myself, I think you were
justified.&nbsp; Youth comes to us but once.&nbsp; And at
twenty-five our business is to live.&nbsp; Undoubtedly the
marriage helped you.&nbsp; You lived an idyllic existence, for a
time, in a tumble-down cottage at Suresnes, with a garden that
went down to the river.&nbsp; Poor, of course you were; poor as
church mice.&nbsp; But who fears poverty when hope and love are
singing on the bough!&nbsp; I really think quite your best work
was done during those years at Suresnes.&nbsp; Ah, the sweetness,
the tenderness of it!&nbsp; There has been nothing like it in
French poetry.&nbsp; It made no mark at the time; but ten years
later the public went mad about it.&nbsp; She was dead
then.&nbsp; Poor child, it had been a hard struggle.&nbsp; And,
as you may remember, she was always fragile.&nbsp; Yet even in
her death I think she helped you.&nbsp; There entered a new note
into your poetry, a depth that had hitherto been wanting.&nbsp;
It was the best thing that ever came to you, your love for
Marguerite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stranger refilled his glass, and passed the
decanter.&nbsp; But the Poet left the wine unheeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, ah, yes, then followed that excursion into
politics.&nbsp; Those scathing articles you wrote for <i>La
Libert&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; It is hardly an exaggeration to say
that they altered the whole aspect of French political
thought.&nbsp; Those wonderful speeches you made during your
election campaign at Angers.&nbsp; How the people worshipped
you!&nbsp; You might have carried your portfolio had you
persisted.&nbsp; But you poets are such restless fellows.&nbsp;
And after all, I daresay you have really accomplished more by
your plays.&nbsp; You remember&mdash;no, of course, how could
you?&mdash;the first night of <i>La Conqu&ecirc;tte</i>.&nbsp;
Shall I ever forget it!&nbsp; I have always reckoned that the
crown of your career.&nbsp; Your marriage with Madame
Deschenelle&mdash;I do not think it was for the public
good.&nbsp; Poor Deschenelle&rsquo;s millions&mdash;is it not
so?&nbsp; Poetry and millions interfere with one another.&nbsp;
But a thousand pardons, my dear Paul.&nbsp; You have done so
much.&nbsp; It is only right you should now be taking your
ease.&nbsp; Your work is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Poet does not answer.&nbsp; Sits staring before him with
eyes turned inward.&nbsp; The Painter, the Musician: what did the
years bring to them?&nbsp; The Stranger tells them also of all
that they have lost: of the griefs and sorrows, of the hopes and
fears they have never tasted, of their tears that ended in
laughter, of the pain that gave sweetness to joy, of the triumphs
that came to them in the days before triumph had lost its savour,
of the loves and the longings and fervours they would never
know.&nbsp; All was ended.&nbsp; The Stranger had given them what
he had promised, what they had desired: the gain without the
getting.</p>
<p>Then they break out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it to me,&rdquo; cries the Painter, &ldquo;that
I wake to find myself wearing the gold medal of the Salon, robbed
of the memory of all by which it was earned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stranger points out to him that he is illogical; such
memories would have included long vistas of meagre dinners in
dingy restaurants, of attic studios, of a life the chief part of
which had been passed amid ugly surroundings.&nbsp; It was to
escape from all such that he had clamoured.&nbsp; The Poet is
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked but for recognition,&rdquo; cries the Musician,
&ldquo;that men might listen to me; not for my music to be taken
from me in exchange for the recompense of a successful
tradesman.&nbsp; My inspiration is burnt out; I feel it.&nbsp;
The music that once filled my soul is mute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was born of the strife and anguish,&rdquo; the
Stranger tells him, &ldquo;of the loves that died, of the hopes
that faded, of the beating of youth&rsquo;s wings against the
bars of sorrow, of the glory and madness and torment called Life,
of the struggle you shrank from facing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Poet takes up the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have robbed us of Life,&rdquo; he cries.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You tell us of dead lips whose kisses we have never felt,
of songs of victory sung to our deaf ears.&nbsp; You have taken
our fires, you have left us but the ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fires that scorch and sear,&rdquo; the Stranger
adds, &ldquo;the lips that cried in their pain, the victory
bought of wounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not yet too late,&rdquo; the Stranger tells
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;All this can be but a troubled dream, growing
fainter with each waking moment.&nbsp; Will you buy back your
Youth at the cost of ease?&nbsp; Will you buy back Life at the
price of tears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They cry with one voice, &ldquo;Give us back our Youth with
its burdens, and a heart to bear them!&nbsp; Give us back Life
with its mingled bitter and sweet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then suddenly the Stranger stands revealed before them.&nbsp;
They see that he is Life&mdash;Life born of battle, Life made
strong by endeavour, Life learning song from suffering.</p>
<p>There follows more talk; which struck me, when I read the
story, as a mistake; for all that he tells them they have now
learnt: that life to be enjoyed must be lived; that victory to be
sweet must be won.</p>
<p>They awake in the dingy <i>caf&eacute;</i> in the Rue St.
Louis.&nbsp; The ancient waiter is piling up the chairs
preparatory to closing the shutters.&nbsp; The Poet draws forth
his small handful of coins; asks what is to pay.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; the waiter answers.&nbsp; A stranger who
sat with them and talked awhile before they fell asleep has paid
the bill.&nbsp; They look at one another, but no one speaks.</p>
<p>The streets are empty.&nbsp; A thin rain is falling.&nbsp;
They turn up the collars of their coats; strike out into the
night.&nbsp; And as their footsteps echo on the glistening
pavement it comes to each of them that they are walking with a
new, brave step.</p>
<p>I feel so sorry for Dick&mdash;for the tens of thousands of
happy, healthy, cared-for lads of whom Dick is the type.&nbsp;
There must be millions of youngsters in the world who have never
known hunger, except as an appetiser to their dinner; who have
never felt what it was to be tired, without the knowledge that a
comfortable bed was awaiting them.</p>
<p>To the well-to-do man or woman life is one perpetual
nursery.&nbsp; They are wakened in the morning&mdash;not too
early, not till the nursery has been swept out and made ready,
and the fire lighted&mdash;awakened gently with a cup of tea to
give them strength and courage for this great business of getting
up&mdash;awakened with whispered words, lest any sudden start
should make their little heads ache&mdash;the blinds carefully
arranged to exclude the naughty sun, which otherwise might shine
into their little eyes and make them fretful.&nbsp; The water,
with the nasty chill off, is put ready for them; they wash their
little hands and faces, all by themselves!&nbsp; Then they are
shaved and have their hair done; their little hands are
manicured, their little corns cut for them.&nbsp; When they are
neat and clean, they toddle into breakfast; they are shown into
their little chairs, their little napkins handed to them; the
nice food that is so good for them is put upon their little
plates; the drink is poured out for them into their cups.&nbsp;
If they want to play, there is the day nursery.&nbsp; They have
only to tell kind nurse what game it is they fancy.&nbsp; The
toys are at once brought out.&nbsp; The little gun is put into
their hand; the little horse is dragged forth from its corner,
their little feet carefully placed in the stirrups.&nbsp; The
little ball and bat is taken from its box.</p>
<p>Or they will take the air, as the wise doctor has
ordered.&nbsp; The little carriage will be ready in five minutes;
the nice warm cloak is buttoned round them, the footstool placed
beneath their feet, the cushion at their back.</p>
<p>The day is done.&nbsp; The games have been played; the toys
have been taken from their tired hands, put back into the
cupboard.&nbsp; The food that is so good for them, that makes
them strong little men and women, has all been eaten.&nbsp; They
have been dressed for going out into the pretty Park, undressed
and dressed again for going out to tea with the little boys and
girls next door; undressed and dressed again for the party.&nbsp;
They have read their little book? have seen a little play, have
looked at pretty pictures.&nbsp; The kind gentleman with the long
hair has played the piano to them.&nbsp; They have danced.&nbsp;
Their little feet are really quite tired.&nbsp; The footman
brings them home.&nbsp; They are put into their little
nighties.&nbsp; The candle is blown out, the nursery door is
softly closed.</p>
<p>Now and again some restless little man, wearying of the smug
nursery, will run out past the garden gate, and down the long
white road; will find the North Pole or, failing that, the South
Pole, or where the Nile rises, or how it feels to fly; will climb
the Mountains of the Moon&mdash;do anything, go anywhere, to
escape from Nurse Civilisation&rsquo;s everlasting apron
strings.</p>
<p>Or some queer little woman, wondering where the people come
from, will run and run till she comes to the great town, watch in
wonder the strange folk that sweat and groan&mdash;the peaceful
nursery, with the toys, the pretty frocks never quite the same
again to her.</p>
<p>But to the nineteen-twentieths of the well-to-do the world
beyond the nursery is an unknown land.&nbsp; Terrible things
occur out there to little men and women who have no pretty
nursery to live in.&nbsp; People push and shove you about, will
even tread on your toes if you are not careful.&nbsp; Out there
is no kind, strong Nurse Bank-Balance to hold one&rsquo;s little
hand, and see that no harm comes to one.&nbsp; Out there, one has
to fight one&rsquo;s own battles.&nbsp; Often one is cold and
hungry, out there.</p>
<p>One has to fend for oneself, out there; earn one&rsquo;s
dinner before one eats it, never quite sure of the week after
next.&nbsp; Terrible things take place, out there: strain and
contest and fierce endeavour; the ways are full of dangers and
surprises; folk go up, folk go down; you have to set your teeth
and fight.&nbsp; Well-to-do little men and women shudder.&nbsp;
Draw down the nursery blinds.</p>
<p>Robina had a little dog.&nbsp; It led the usual dog&rsquo;s
life: slept in a basket on an eiderdown cushion, sheltered from
any chance draught by silk curtains; its milk warmed and
sweetened; its cosy chair reserved for it, in winter, near the
fire; in summer, where the sun might reach it; its three meals a
day that a gourmet might have eaten gladly; its very fleas taken
off its hands.</p>
<p>And twice a year still extra care was needed, lest it should
wantonly fling aside its days and nights of luxurious ease, claim
its small share of the passion and pain that go to the making of
dogs and men.&nbsp; For twice a year there came a wind, salt with
the brine of earth&rsquo;s ceaseless tides, whispering to it of a
wondrous land whose sharpest stones are sweeter than the silken
cushions of all the world without.</p>
<p>One winter&rsquo;s night there was great commotion.&nbsp;
Babette was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; We were living in the
country, miles away from everywhere.&nbsp; &ldquo;Babette,
Babette,&rdquo; cried poor frenzied Robina; and for answer came
only the laughter of the wind, pausing in his game of romps with
the snow-flakes.</p>
<p>Next morning an old woman from the town four miles away
brought back Babette at the end of a string.&nbsp; Oh, such a
soaked, bedraggled Babette!&nbsp; The old woman had found her
crouching in a doorway, a bewildered little heap of palpitating
femininity; and, reading the address upon her collar, and may be
scenting a not impossible reward, had thought she might as well
earn it for herself.</p>
<p>Robina was shocked, disgusted.&nbsp; To think that
Babette&mdash;dainty, petted, spoilt Babette&mdash;should have
chosen of her own accord to go down into the mud and darkness of
the vulgar town; to leave her curtained eiderdown to tramp the
streets like any drab!&nbsp; Robina, to whom Babette had hitherto
been the ideal dog, moved away to hide her tears of
vexation.&nbsp; The old dame smiled.&nbsp; She had borne her good
man eleven, so she told us.&nbsp; It had been a hard struggle,
and some had gone down, and some were dead; but some, thank God,
were doing well.</p>
<p>The old dame wished us good day; but as she turned to go an
impulse seized her.&nbsp; She crossed to where Babette, ashamed,
yet half defiant, sat a wet, woeful little image on the
hearthrug, stooped and lifted the little creature in her thin,
worn arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s trouble you&rsquo;ve brought
yourself,&rdquo; said the old dame.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t help it, could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babette&rsquo;s little pink tongue stole out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand, we know&mdash;we Mothers,&rdquo; they
seemed to be saying to one another.</p>
<p>And so the two kissed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I think the terrace will be my favourite spot.&nbsp;
Ethelbertha thinks, too, that on sunny days she will like to sit
there.&nbsp; From it, through an opening I have made in the
trees, I can see the cottage just a mile away at the edge of the
wood.&nbsp; Young Bute tells me it is the very place he has been
looking for.&nbsp; Most of his time, of course, he has to pass in
town, but his Fridays to Mondays he likes to spend in the
country.&nbsp; Maybe I shall hand it over to him.&nbsp; St.
Leonard&rsquo;s chimneys we can also see above the trees.&nbsp;
Dick tells me he has quite made up his mind to become a
farmer.&nbsp; He thinks it would be a good plan, for a beginning,
to go into partnership with St. Leonard.&nbsp; It is not unlikely
that St. Leonard&rsquo;s restless temperament may prompt him
eventually to tire of farming.&nbsp; He has a brother in Canada
doing well in the lumber business, and St. Leonard often talks of
the advantages of the colonies to a man who is bringing up a
large family.&nbsp; I shall be sorry to lose him as a neighbour;
though I see the advantages, under certain possibilities, of Mrs.
St. Leonard&rsquo;s address being Manitoba.</p>
<p>Veronica also thinks the terrace may come to be her favourite
resting-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Veronica, &ldquo;that if
anything was to happen to Robina, everything would fall on
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a change, Veronica,&rdquo; I
suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hitherto it is you who have done most of
the falling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I&rsquo;ve got to see about growing up,&rdquo;
said Veronica.</p>

1.F.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
